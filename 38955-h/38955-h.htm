<h2><a name="Drainage"></a>Drainage and Good Husbandry.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>BY C. G. ELLIOTT, DRAINAGE ENGINEER.</b></p>

<p class="p2 center">I.</p>

<p>The practical advantage of drainage as it appears to the casual
observer, is in the increased production of valuable crops. Ordinary land
is improved, and worthless land so far reclaimed as to yield a profit to
its owner, where once it was a source of loss and a blemish upon an
otherwise fair district. The land-buyer who looks for a future rise in his
purchase, recognizes the value of drainage, being careful to invest his
capital in land which has natural drainage, or is capable of being drained
artificially with no great expense, if it is suitable for use as an
agricultural domain. The physician, though perhaps unwilling, is obliged
to admit drainage as an important agency in the reduction of malignant
diseases and much general ill-health among dwellers in both country and
village. Our State Board of Health recognizes the influence of land
drainage upon the healthfulness of districts where it is practiced. The
Secretary of this Board gives it as his opinion that even good road
drainage would diminish the number of preventable diseases 25 per
cent.</p>

<p>Such are now some of the impressions as to the value of drainage among
those who judge from acknowledged effects. That a great change has been
brought about by this practice is apparent to the most superficial
observer, if he compares pre-drainage with the present.</p>

<p class="p2 center">A FEW FACTS.</p>

<p>The Indiana Bureau of Statistics made an investigation about two years
ago of the influence of tile drainage upon production and health in that
State. Two periods of five years were selected, one before drainage was
begun, and the other after most of the farms had been drained, the area
examined being one township in Johnson county.</p>

<p>As near as could be determined, the average yearly yield of wheat for a
period of five consecutive years before drainage was nine and a half
bushels per acre. The same land and tillage after drainage in a period of
five consecutive years produced an average of nineteen and one-fourth
bushels per acre. Comparing the corn crops in the same way for the same
time, it was found that the average yearly yield before drainage was
thirty-one and three-fourths bushels per acre, and after drainage
seventy-four and one-fourth bushels per acre.</p>

<p>In order to determine the influence of drainage upon health,
physicians, who had, during the same two periods of five years each,
answered all calls in cases of disease, were asked to report from their
books all cases of malarial fever. It was found from this data that, for
the first period of five years before drainage, there had been 1,480 cases
of malarial disease. During the next five years under a pretty good system
of drainage, there were but 490 cases of such disease. These facts show
that drainage not only brings material prosperity to the individual, but
promotes the general healthfulness of the climate of that district, in
which all are interested and all enjoy.</p>

<p>It is a matter of note that the Campagne about Rome, which in ancient
days was the healthful home of a dense population, is now afflicted with
the most deadly fevers. It is claimed by high authorities that this is due
to the destruction and choking of the drains which in excavating are found
everywhere, but always filled and useless.</p>

<p>It will be readily seen that this subject has at least two important
bearings upon our prosperity, and though in considering and perfecting
general farm drainage, the effect upon health may be manifested without
effort being put forth in that direction, yet it should always be kept in
mind and receive that consideration which it deserves.</p>

<p class="center p2">DRAINAGE AND FANCY FARMING.</p>

<p>It is thought by many who have not yet tested the value of tile
drainage, that it is one of those luxuries often indulged in by so-called
fancy farmers. By such farmers is meant those who farm for pleasure rather
than for profit; those who raise wheat which costs them $1 per bushel, but
which is worth only eighty cents on the market; those who raise beef at a
cost of ten cents per lb. and sell it for six cents per lb.; in
short, they are men (and there are many of them) who receive their income
from some other source, and cultivate a farm for recreation. That drainage
properly belongs to this class of farmers is a mistaken notion, as
hundreds of thrifty, money-making farmers in the West would prove, could
they now give their experience. In the example previously given, drainage
increased the production of wheat and corn fully 100 per cent, which was a
township report for five years. In order to emphasize these statements, we
will insert a few practical examples communicated to the Drainage Journal
during last year.</p>

<p>Geo. P. Robertson: "One ten-acre field failed to produce anything
except a few small ears. I drained it, and have cropped it for eight years
successively, and have paid time and again for husking 100 bushels of corn
per acre."</p>

<p>"Mr. Losee, Norwich, Canada, says that as a matter of actual test, his
underdrained land yields one-third larger crops than his undrained fields,
although the same treatment in other respects is applied, and the land is
of the same character throughout. The average wheat yield of his undrained
land is twenty bushels per acre, while the drained fields yielded an
average of thirty bushels. As the cost of draining on his farm is
estimated at $20 per acre, this preparation of the soil pays for itself in
two years."</p>

<p>Horton Ferguson, Indiana: "The swamp contained twenty-seven acres, and
was regarded by all neighbors as utterly worthless except for hunting
grounds. Mr. Ferguson, who has great faith in underdraining, determined to
undertake to reclaim the land, confident if successfully done, it would be
a paying investment. Last year he tile drained and grubbed it, paying
customary rates for all the labor and tile, and this year put it in corn,
with the following result:</p>

<table summary="Cost to Drain Swamp">

<tr><td></td><td class="center">Dr.</td><td class="center">Cr.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="left">Tile used for 27 acres</td>
<td class="right">$544 87</td></tr>

<tr><td class="left">Paid for ditching</td>
<td class="right">88 00</td></tr>

<tr><td class="left">Expense for clearing and grubbing</td>
<td class="right">275 00</td></tr>

<tr><td class="left">Total expense</td>
<td class="right"><span class="o">$907 87</span></td></tr>

<tr><td class="left">By 2,530 bushels of corn at 50 cents</td>
<td></td><td class="right"><span class="o">$1,265 00</span></td></tr>

</table>

<p>The land proved to be remarkably rich, having produced, as shown,
ninety bushels to the acre, and Mr. F. assures us that several acres
exceeded 100 bushels to the acre. It will thus be observed that he
realized the first year of cultivation enough to pay the entire expense of
reclaiming and had $357.13 left to pay on the crop expense. Next season,
if favorable, he expects a still better yield." <span class="pagenum">[Pg
178]</span> Every farmer knows that, in these times of easy
transportation, profits do not depend so much upon the price his product
brings in the market as upon the quantity he has to dispose of. In other
words, abundant crops are the farmer's source of income. There is evidence
enough at hand to justify the statement that of all improvements put upon
farms containing wet land valued at $40 per acre and upwards, drainage
pays the largest profit for the outlay. Just what this profit will be will
depend upon the soil drained, the necessary cost required to improve it,
and the use and management of it after it is drained. All of these things
vary so that each case must be considered by itself. Drainage is simply a
necessary part of good husbandry which merits the careful consideration of
all thinking farmers.</p>

<hr class="c33" />

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Flood_Gate"></a>Plan for a Flood Gate.</h2>

<p>To maintain a fence across a water course, is one of the trials and
tribulations of the farmer. After a heavy rain, generally fences in such
places are either badly damaged or entirely washed away. Having been
troubled this way for years, I have hit upon the following plan, which,
after two years' trial I find to be a success.</p>

<p>A stick of timber, three or four inches in diameter, is placed where
the gate is needed, and fastened down with stakes, driven slanting, on
each side, the tops of the stakes lapping over the piece so as to hold it
securely, and driven well down, so as not to catch the drift, but allowing
the piece to turn freely; inch and half holes are bored in the piece and
uprights are fitted in them; the material of which the gate is made is
fastened to these uprights. A light post is driven on the lower side and
the gate fastened to it.</p>

<p>This will keep the gate in place in any ordinary flood, but when a Noah
comes along, it turns down on the bottom of creek, and waters and drifts
pass over it. When the water subsides all that is necessary to do is to
turn the gate back to its upright position. If the gate is not needed
during the winter, it is better to lay it down and let it remain in that
position until spring, for if it is fastened with the post in an upright
position, it will be broken with the spring floods.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Corn_Crops"></a>Great Corn Crops.</h2>

<p>It having been mentioned in the Iowa State Register some weeks ago that
Mr. Hezekiah Fagan, of Polk county, in that State, had once grown one
hundred and fifty-eight bushels of corn per acre, a son of Mr. Fagan
writes the following regarding the kinds of corn, the ground, and the
manner of cultivation:</p>

<p>"Father's farm joined Brown's Park on the north and run a mile north;
the corn was raised where the old orchard now is; it was part prairie and
part brush land, and was about the third crop. The ground was plowed in
the spring, harrowed and marked out with a single shovel both ways, the
rows being four feet apart each way. The corn was dropped by hand and
covered with a hoe, and left without harrowing until large enough to plow,
and was plowed twice with single shovel, and once with the two horse
stirring plow and hilled up as high as possible, and hoed enough to keep
clean. The seed was from corn father brought from Rockville, Ind., with
him when he moved to Des Moines, in the spring of 1848, and was of the
large, yellow variety which matured then and matures now with anything
like a good season, and I verily believe that with as good ground and as
good treatment and as much care in having every hill standing, and from
three to four stalks in every hill, that the amount might be raised again,
if it was over 150 bushels per acre, and I must say that I have never seen
a large variety of corn that suited me so well, that would yield so much,
or mature so well, and if any Iowa farmer will come and look at my crib of
corn of this year's raising, and if he will say he can show a better
average ear raised on similar ground, with similar treatment, I would like
to speak for a few bushels for seed at almost any price, and I will not
except the much-puffed Leaming variety."</p>

<p>The young man adds that his advice to Iowa farmers is, "to raise big
horses, big cattle, big hogs, big corn, and big grass, and if the profits
are not big, too, they had better make up their minds farming isn't their
forte, and go at something else."</p>

<p>Being desirous of knowing something of his big corn yield we wrote to
Mr. Clarkson, of the Register, for further information, and received the
following reply:</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir:</span> Yours of the
7th inst., relative to the Fagan corn received. The corn raised by
Hezekiah Fagan was thirty years ago, and he received the premium for it at
the Iowa State Fair in 1854. The only facts I have relative to it are in
the published proceedings of the State Agricultural Society. It states
that he raised in Polk county, Iowa, on five acres, at the rate of 139&#189;
bushels per acre, shelled corn. The whole, shelled, measured 697&#189;
bushels, but weighed, it made 151 bushels and fifty-three pounds per
acre.</p>

<p class="blockquote">At the same fair, J. W. Inskip exhibited, with all
of the necessary proofs, 136 bushels per acre.</p>

<p class="blockquote">I think there was no mistake in these matters, as
great care was taken to have statement correct; it is to this crop which
his son refers in a late number of the Register. Yours truly,</p>

<p>At the head of the agricultural department in <span class="smcap">The
Prairie Farmer</span> I notice a standing invitation, viz.: "Farmers,
write for your paper." All right! Now, if you will just move up a little
I'll take a seat in your Communicative Association.</p>

<p>We, that is my wife and myself, eagerly read and discuss the
interesting articles with which <span class="smcap">The Prairie
Farmer</span> is replete every week, and many are the practical hints that
we have found therein.</p>

<p>It is not strange that, in the heart of a new country with vast
undeveloped resources and unlimited possibilities, a young farmer who has
his fortune yet to make, should be particularly enthusiastic. Tired of the
atmosphere of the school-room, fagged out by ten years of study and
teaching, and plainly seeing the improbability of being able to lay by
enough for a rainy day or old age in this noble, but as a rule,
unremunerative calling, my mind involuntarily reverted back to my early
life on the old homestead in Illinois, to substantials implied in that
word, and to its pleasant memories.</p>

<p>My mind was made up. With my portion of the old homestead in my pocket,
I turned the key in the school-house door, grateful for the experience and
lessons of patience gained inside of it, a friend of education, and with a
heart full of sympathy for the teachers of our public schools. I came to
"the land of the Dakotas" once more to break the "stubborn glebe" and
enjoy the sweets of farm life. Next June I shall have had three years'
experience in my new undertaking. I have succeeded fairly well. At some
future time I may communicate something about raising wheat and vegetables
in Dakota, to the readers of "our paper."</p>

<p>This winter is proving to be rather long and stormy, but with plenty of
fuel, good books and papers, time has not hung heavily on my hands.
Indeed, I consider these long Northern winters a decided advantage to
those who regard the cultivation of the mind as important as the
cultivation of the fields. I am afraid the majority of farmers do not lay
enough stress upon mental culture. In this age of cheap books there can be
no excuse for being without them. Systematic reading leads to the best
results in mental culture just as systematic farming leads to the best
results in agriculture. At the beginning of the winter I select some
standard work as my principal reading matter and stick to it until I have
it completed, reading for an interlude, good weekly newspapers, and one or
two of the standard magazines, with which I always like to be supplied.
This breaks up all monotony, and makes reading thoroughly enjoyable and
instructive. This winter I am reading the works of Goethe, the great
German author.</p>

<p>March, the last winter month, has come, and although the wind is still
howling and snow flying, before the first of April we expect to see the
railroads thronged with emigrant cars bringing new settlers, more thrift
and more capital. Thousands of new homes will be established on the
fertile prairies next summer.</p>

<p>Will you please regard this as a kind of an introduction into your
"association?"</p>

<p>If we find that we are mutually agreeable perhaps we shall find
occasion to meet again.</p>

<p>The article on prairie roads in <span class="smcap">The Prairie
Farmer</span> of March 1st, 1884, by A. G. H., of Champaign county, was
good, and I would like to see more on the same subject. If we get any
better roads, we must keep the ball rolling.</p>

<p>The great objection to the Ross plan, or any plan of road-tiling here,
is this. When tile is laid in the roadway the teams will travel right over
it, and the black soil gets packed and puddled until it is as impervious
to water as clay, and the water can't get into the tile. And on the clay
hillsides, if the tile is covered with clay, the water can't get into it.
This has been well tested here, for we have been road-tiling for six
years.</p>

<p>The question seems to be to get the water into the tile. The answer is
simple enough. We must provide sink holes for it. We must fill the ditch
over the tile with sand, gravel, or anything that will let the water in, a
yard in length, say, once every rod. Then I think the Ross plan would be
perfect.</p>

<p>As to the cost, well, $750 per mile seems large, but to take an average
of the roads in our county one-half that sum would answer, for it is only
the worst places would need the full Ross plan.</p>

<p>In a good many places, one string of tile with gravel sinks would do,
and others with the laterals to drain all to one side, thus saving the
cost of one string of tile, or more than one-third of the whole cost.</p>

<p>Now, if we get the commissioners to commence the work, we must vote for
men who are in favor of road-tiling as commissioners. There is where the
battle must be fought. Buckle on the armor comrades and see that the work
is done.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Experiments"></a>Experiments With Indian
Corn.</h2>

<p>On May 16, 135 kinds of corn were planted in the garden, with the
intention of promoting the cross fertilization of the varieties in order
to study the effects. The seed used was some of it selected on account of
its purity; other seed was from named varieties, still other seed from
varieties purposely hybridized, or presumed from their appearance or
location on the ear to be hybridized; and seed which possessed
peculiarities in appearance. The types represented were the three kinds of
pop-corns, the flint pop, the pearl pop, and the rice pop; the flints in
eight-rowed and twelve-rowed varieties, and soft or Tuscarora's; the
sweets in two or more types of ear, the one corresponding to the flint,
another to the dent corn ear; and the dents also in two or more types, the
eight-rowed with broad kernel, and another, the many rowed, with deep
kernel. We also had a pod or husk corn.</p>

<p>Through a study of the crop from these various seeds, we are enabled to
make some general conclusions, which probably are sufficient to generalize
from, but which certainly apply to the case in hand.</p>

<p>The seed of the preceding year gives uniformity of ear; that is, a dent
corn seed may produce an eight-rowed flint, or an eighteen-rowed dent, but
each ear will be perfect of its kind, and will be free from kernels of
other type than its own. The flint corn kernel may produce several
varieties of flint corn ear, or dent corn ear, but there will be no
variety in the kernel upon the ear; a dent corn seed may furnish a sweet
corn ear, and dent corn ears, but not mixed upon the cob. A pop-corn
kernel may produce a sweet corn ear, of sweet corn type, a sweet corn ear
of pop-corn type, or a pop-corn ear of the various types, without
admixture of kernels upon the ears.</p>

<p>On the other hand, hybridization of the current year produces changes
in the kernel, so that one ear of corn may bear kernels of various colors,
and of various types, the tendency, however, being for the shape of the
kernel to be governed by the type of the maize ear upon which it is
found.</p>

<p>The appearance of various types upon an ear allow of some curious
generalizations. Thus, the rice pop kernel form does not appear upon ears
of other character, nor does the pearl pop kernel form appear upon the
rice pop ear. The flint pop does not seem to appear upon either the rice
or the pearl pop type, so far as form is concerned, but its structure,
however, influences. Sweet corn, however, appears upon the three types of
pop-corn indiscriminately, but, on the other hand, the pop-corns do not
appear upon the flint corn ears. While flint corn appears abundantly on
sweet corn ears, on the other hand, sweet corn does not appear upon the
flint corns. Dent corn kernels will appear upon the sweet corn whose type
of ear is that of the dent ear, but not upon sweet corn whose type is that
of the flint ear. The dent corn, again, does not appear upon the flint
ear, but in some isolated instances the flint corn kernel may appear upon
the dent ear.</p>

<p>The appearance of kernels of one variety upon ears of another variety,
for each of the types, is of frequent and constant occurrence, except in
the case of red ears. The red ears have a constancy of color which is
truly remarkable: where sweet corn appears upon red pop and red dent ears
the sweet corn partakes of the red color.</p>

<p>The practical value of these deductions consists in the guide they
afford toward the improvement of the varieties of corn that we grow. For
instance: by planting in adjoining hills, or, better still, the mixed seed
of two varieties of corn, one of which is distinguished for its length of
ear and smallness of cob, and the other for the large size of its kernel,
we should anticipate, in many instances, the transfer of the large kernel
to the small ear and of the small kernel to the large ear. By selecting
from the crop those ears which have length and the large kernel, we should
anticipate, by a series of selections, the attaining of a new variety, in
which the large kernel and length of cob would be persistent. The same
remarks hold true with the dent corns. But in the matter of selections the
true principle would seem to be to plant but one kernel of the desired
type from an ear of the desired type, and to keep the plant from this
kernel free from the influence of plants of another type, and securing the
crop through self-fertilization. After the first year of this procedure,
by the selection of two or more kernels of the same type from different
plants, cross fertilization should be used, the crop being gradually
purified by selection.</p>

<p>While the maize plant, as a rule, is not self-fertilized, that is, as a
general thing the pollen from one plant fertilizes the silk of another,
yet in very many cases the pollen and the silk upon the same plant is
synchronous, and self-fertilization becomes possible, and undoubtedly is
of frequent occurrence. The pollen ripens from below upward, and thus the
fall of the pollen, through the successive ripening of the blooms, may
last for three or four days, and there is a great variation in period of
blooming as between individual plants. The silk maintains its receptivity
for pollen for some little time, but for how long a period we do not yet
know from direct observation. It seems, however, true, that closely
following pollination<a name= "fnanchor_e" id= "fnanchor_e"></a><a href=
"#footnote_e" class= "fnanchor">[e]</a>, the silk loses its transparent
structure and begins to shrivel, while before pollination is effected the
silk retains its succulency for several days.&mdash;<i>E. Lewis

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Specialty_Farming"></a>Specialty Farming.</h2>

<p>I noticed in <span class="smcap">The Prairie Farmer</span> of February
23d, a communication from Cape Girardeau, Mo., on "The Dignity of Our
Calling." It contains some very good reasoning, but I do not indorse it
all, and take this mode of expressing my views upon the subject. The point
upon which<a name= "fnanchor_f" id= "fnanchor_f"></a><a href=
"#footnote_f" class= "fnanchor">[f]</a> I beg leave to differ from the
gentleman is, should a farmer have a smattering idea of everything
pertaining to farming?</p>

<p>I believe that a man should make a specialty of some particular branch
of farming, for it is universally conceded by all competent authority that
no man can succeed in a given pursuit unless his time and energies are
concentrated in that direction, consequently we have successful men in all
the avenues of life&mdash;and why? from the simple fact that these men
make a specialty of some particular branch of their calling; they are no
jack-of-all-trades&mdash;not by any means.</p>

<p>So it is with farming; the man who endeavors to be proficient in all
its departments is apt to be a failure, while his specialist neighbor
succeeds, simply because he has his course marked out, and bends his
energies in that direction. Life is too short for a man to comprehend
everything. It is true, that the farmer has no fixed law by which to guide
him; however, he must, in measure, be governed by past experience. If the
farmer does his part, God will do the rest. In my opinion, what we want,
is not learning in every branch of farming by the same individual, but we
do want lore in a given direction, and then success will crown our every
effort. Take as an example one of our large machine shops; do we find its
workmen, each one, commencing a machine and completing it in all its
parts. No; each man has a special task to perform, only that and nothing
more. As to farmers' sons longing for other callings, I am forced to admit
that it is a lamentable fact which can not be ignored. I believe the
reason for this is that they are constantly coming in contact with nature
in all her varied forms, and before they have yet reached their majority,
they become inspired with an ambition which is prone to go beyond the
boundary of farm life, hence we find them, step by step, climbing the
ladder of fame. However, we have one consoling fact, and that is, they
make some of the most noted men we have&mdash;find them where you may. A
glorious example of this is in the person of a man who rose from the
humble position of plowboy, to that of Chief Executive of the Nation.</p>

<p>A few words more and I am done. If the fathers of this land would have
their sons follow the noble vocation of farming, let them educate them
thoroughly for the branch which they would have them pursue, and by so
doing teach them that proficiency in any given direction is sure to
command respect and success.</p>

<p>One of the strong points in preparing horses for spring work is in
having their shoulders in a good, sound condition. With this to start with
and soft and well-fitting collars there need be but little fear of any
difficulty in keeping them all right, no matter how hard the labor horses
have to endure. By keeping the collars well cleared of any dirt which may
accumulate upon them from the sweating of the horse, and by bathing them
daily with cold water, there need be but little fear of bad shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Husbandman</span>: Every member of the Elmira
Farmers' Club present had used sapling clover, more or less, and all
regarded it with favor, although for making hay common red clover is worth
more, as it is also for pasture. Mr. Ward expressed the opinion, in which
all shared, that there were really but two varieties of field clover in
common use at the North, red clover, usually called medium, and the large,
or sapling clover. The chief function of the clover root as a fertilizer
is in bringing nitrogen from the lower soil upward within reach of
succeeding crops and changing its form to meet the requirements of the
plant and crops that follow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brow Chemical Co. Circular</span>: The wise farmer
will change his seed from year to year. A remarkable feature of the
variety in potatoes is that no two kinds of potato are made up of the same
chemical components in precisely the same proportion. There are now over
300 varieties of potatoes of greater or less merit. Some are celebrated
for their large size, some for their fineness of texture and some for the
great increase which may be expected from them. One hundred and thirteen
years ago there were but two known varieties of potatoes, one being white,
the other red. If the soil is too poor potatoes starve, if too wet they
catch cold, and refuse to grow to perfection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farmer's Advocate</span>: Spring operations will
soon commence, and with these a demand for good farm hands. The general
rule that is followed in this country is to put off the hiring of men to
the last moment, and trust to chances for some one coming along, and then
probably some inferior workman has to be taken, or none at all. Men who
know their business on a farm will not wait, and are early picked up in
the neighborhood in which they may reside. The trusting to men coming
along just at the exact moment you are crowded, is a bad policy. There
should always be profitable employment for a man in the early spring
months before seeding commences, and it will pay any farmer to secure good
farm hands early; and pay them good wages.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peoria Transcript</span>: We prepared a half acre
of ground as good as we knew how. Upon one-half of this plat we planted
one bushel of seed obtained from Michigan, and upon the other half of
home-grown seed, both being of the variety known as Snowflake. The two
lots of seed cut for planting were similar in appearance, both as regards
size and quality. The whole lot received the same<a name= "fnanchor_g" id=
"fnanchor_g"></a><a href= "#footnote_g" class= "fnanchor">[g]</a>
treatment during the growing season. The plants made about the same growth
on the two plats and suffered equally from bugs; but when it came to
digging, those from new seed yielded two bushels of large potatoes for
every one that could be secured on the land planted with seed of our own
growing. This difference in yield could be accounted for on no other
theory than the change in seed, as the quality of seed, soil, and culture
were the same. This leads to the belief that simply procuring seed of
favorite varieties from a distance would insure us good crops at much less
expense than can be done experimenting with new, high-priced seeds.</p>

<p>In another column a Kansas correspondent speaks of the crab grass in an
exceedingly favorable way. We find the following regarding this grass in a
late New York Times: Every Northern farmer knows the common coarse grass
called door-yard grass, which has long, broad leaves, a tough, bunchy
root, and a three-fingered spreading head, which contains large, round
seeds. It is known as Eleusine Indica, and grows luxuriously in open
drains and moist places. It appears late in the summer. This is an
extremely valuable grass in the South. A friend who went to Georgia soon
after the war bought an abandoned plantation on account of the grass
growing upon it. It was this door-yard grass. He pastured sheep upon it
and cut some for hay. Northern baled hay was selling at $30 a ton at that
time. He wrote asking me to<a name= "fnanchor_h" id= "fnanchor_h"></a><a
href= "#footnote_h" class= "fnanchor">[h]</a> buy him two mowers and a
baling press, and went to baling hay for the Southern market, selling his
sheep and living an easy life except in haying time. His three hundred
acres of cleared land has produced an average of 200 tons of hay every
year which gives him about four times as much profit as an acre of cotton
would do. Perhaps there may come an end to this business, and the grass
will run out for want of fresh seed, but with a yearly dressing of
Charleston phosphate the grass has kept up its original vigor. Now why
could we not make some use of this grass, and of others, such as
quack-grass, which defy so persistently all our efforts to destroy
them?</p>

<h2 class="no-break">Insects in Illinois.</h2>

<p>Prof. Forbes, State Entomologist, makes the following report to the
State Board of Agriculture:</p>

<p>"Now that our year's entomological campaign is completed, a brief
review of some of its most important features and results will doubtless
be of interest. Early attention was given to the insects attacking corn in
the ground, before the sprout has appeared above the surface. A surprising
number were found to infest it at this period, the results of their
injuries being usually attributed by farmers to the weather, defective
seed, etc. Among these the seed corn maggot (Anthomyia zeæ) was frequently
noted, and was received from many parts of the State. A small,
black-headed maggot, the larva of a very abundant, gnat-like fly (Seiara),
was excessively common in ground which had been previously in grass, and
attacked the seed corn if it did not germinate promptly and vigorously,
but apparently did not injure perfectly sound and healthy grains. A minute
yellow ant (Solenopsis fugax) was seen actually gnawing and licking away
the substance of the sound kernels in the ground, both before and after
they had sprouted. The corn plant-louse (Aphis maidis) was an early and
destructive enemy of the crop, often throttling the young shoot before it
had broken ground. It was chiefly confined to fields which had been just
previously in corn or grass.</p>

<p>"The chinch-bug was found in spring depositing the eggs for its first
brood of young about the roots of the corn, a habit not hitherto
reported.</p>

<p>"With the increasing attention to the culture of sorghum, its insect
enemies are coming rapidly to the front. Four species of plant-lice, two
of them new, made a vigorous attack upon this crop in the vicinity of
Champaign, and two of them were likewise abundant in broom-corn.</p>

<p>"The corn root-worm (Diabrotica longicornis) was occasionally met with
in sorghum, but does not seem likely to do any great mischief to that
plant. It could not be found in broom-corn. In fields of maize, however,
it was again very destructive, where corn had been raised on the same
ground a year or two before. The Hessian Fly did great damage throughout
the winter wheat region of the State, many fields not being worth
harvesting in consequence of its ravages. Several facts were collected
tending to show that it is three brooded in the southern part of the
State. Nearly or quite all the last brood passed the summer as "flax
seeds" in the stubble, where they might easily have been destroyed by
general and concerted action. Fortunately, the summer weather was
unfavorable to their development; and the drouth conspired with their
parasites to greatly diminish their numbers. In the regions under our
observation, not one in a thousand emerged from the midsummer pupa-cases,
and numbers of the larvæ were found completely dried up.</p>

<p>"The wheat straw-worm (Isosoma tritici), a minute, slender, yellow
grub, which burrows inside the growing stem, dwarfing or blighting the
forming head, was abundant throughout the winter wheat region of Southern
Illinois, causing, in some places, a loss scarcely exceeded by that due to
the Hessian Fly. Our breeding experiments demonstrate that this insect
winters in the straw as larvæ or pupa, emerging as an adult fly early in
spring, these flies laying their eggs upon the stems after they commence
to joint. As the flies are very minute, and nearly all are wingless, their
spread from field to field is slow, and it seems entirely within the power
of the individual farmer to control this insect by burning or otherwise
destroying the stubble in summer or autumn, and burning the surplus of the
straw not fed to stock early in spring. A simple rotation of crops,
devoting land previously in wheat to some other grain or to grass, will
answer instead of burning the stubble.</p>

<p>"The life history of the wheat bulb-worm (Meromyza Americana) was
completed this year. The second or summer brood did decided injury to
wheat in Fulton county, so many of the heads being killed that some of the
fields looked gray at a little distance. This species was also injurious
to rye, but much less so than to wheat. It certainly does not attack oats
at all; fields of that grain raised where winter wheat had been destroyed
by it, and plowed up, being entirely free from it, while wheat fields
adjacent were badly damaged. We have good evidence that postponement of
sowing to as late a date as possible prevents the ravages of this insect,
in the same way as it does those of the Hessian Fly.</p>

<p>"The common rose chafer (Macrodactylus subspinosus) greatly injured
some fields of corn in Will county, the adult beetle devouring the
leaves.</p>

<p>"The 'flea negro-bug' (Thyreocoris pulicarius) was found injurious to
wheat in Montgomery county, draining the sap from the heads before
maturity, so that the kernel shriveled and ripened prematurely. In parts
of some fields the crop was thus almost wholly destroyed.</p>

<p>"The entomological record of the orchard and the fruit garden is not
less eventful than that of the farm. In extreme Southern Illinois, the
forest tent caterpillar (Clislocampa sylvatica) made a frightful inroad
upon the apple orchard, absolutely defoliating every tree in large
districts. It also did great mischief to many forest trees. Its injuries
to fruit might have been almost wholly prevented, either by destroying the
eggs upon the twigs of the trees in autumn, as was successfully done by
many, or by spraying the foliage of infested trees in spring with Paris
green, or similar poison, as was done with the best effect and at but
slight expense by Mr. David Ayres, of Villa Ridge. Great numbers of these
caterpillars were killed by a contagious disease, which swept them off
just as they were ready to transform to the chrysalis; but vast quantities
of the eggs are now upon the trees, ready to hatch in spring.</p>

<p>"A large apple orchard in Hancock county dropped a great part of its
crop on account of injuries done to the fruit by the plum curculio
(Conotrachelus nenuphar). There is little question that these insects were
forced to scatter through the apple orchard by the destruction, the
previous autumn, of an old peach orchard which had been badly infested by
them.</p>

<p>"In Southern strawberry fields, very serious loss was occasioned by the
tarnished plant-bug (Lygus lineolaris), which I have demonstrated to be at
least a part of the cause of the damage known as the 'buttoning' of the
berry. The dusky plant-bug (Deræcoris rapidus) worked upon the
strawberries in precisely the same manner and at the same time, in some
fields being scarcely less abundant than the other. I have found that both
these species may be promptly and cheaply killed by pyrethrum, either
diluted with flour or suspended in water, and also by an emulsion of
kerosene, so diluted with water that the mixture shall contain about 3 per
cent of kerosene.</p>

<p>"The so-called 'strawberry root-worm' of Southern Illinois proves to be
not one species merely, but three&mdash;the larvæ of Colaspsis brunnae,
Paria aterrima and Scelodonta pubescens. The periods and life histories of
these three species are curiously different, so that they succeed each
other in their attacks upon the strawberry roots, instead of competing for
food at the same time. The three together infest the plant during nearly
the whole growing season&mdash;Colaspsis first, Paria next, and Scelodonta
last. The beetles all feed upon the leaves in July and August, and may
then be poisoned with Paris green.</p>

<p>"The season has been specially characterized by the occurrence of
several widespread and destructive contagious diseases among insects.
Elaborate studies of these have demonstrated that they are due to bacteria
and other parasitic fungi, that these disease germs may be artificially
cultivated outside the bodies of the insects, and that when sown or
sprinkled upon the food of healthy individuals, the disease follows as a
consequence. We have in this the beginning of a new method of combating
insect injuries which promises some useful results."</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Polled"></a>Polled Aberdeen Cattle.</h2>

<p>The subject of our 1st page illustration, Black Prince, is a
representative of that black, hornless race, which had its foundation in
Scotland several hundred years ago, known as Polled Aberdeen-Angus Cattle.
This breed of cattle has grown into very high favor in America during the
last five or six years; so much so, that, while in 1879 the number of
representatives of this race in America were very few, now the demand for
them is so great that the number imported yearly is easily disposed of at
prices ranging from $250 to $2,000. Messrs. Geary Bros., London, Ont., say
that the demand for such cattle during the past winter has never been
equaled in their long experience. As the prevalence of the foot-and-mouth
disease in Great Britain, will, without a doubt cause the importation of
cattle from that country to be prohibited at an early day, it is safe to
say that the value of such stock must rise, as the number of its
representatives in America is limited, and those who have such stock in
their possession fully appreciate their value; and not being under the
necessity of selling, will hold their Aberdeen-Angus cattle unless enticed
by a very high price. Therefore, the coming public sale of Aberdeen-Angus
cattle in Chicago may be looked forward to as going to show unequaled
average prices and especially of individual prize animals.</p>

<p>Black Prince was bought by Messrs. Geary Bros., London, Ont., in
Scotland, and brought to America last year. In him are to be found all the
fine characteristics of his race. He took the second place at the
Smithfield Fat Stock Show of 1883; at the Kansas Fat Stock Show of the
same year he was placed second to the Short-horn steer Starlight; and at
the last Fat Stock Show of Chicago he took first place among the best
three-year-olds of the country. At the time of entry for the Chicago Show
he was 1,380 days old, and his weight 2,330 pounds, almost 175 pounds less
than he weighed before leaving Scotland for this country. Besides the
prizes above mentioned, Black Prince won numerous honors in his own
country before coming here.</p>

<p>Their black, glossy, thick coats, their hornless heads, and
particularly their low-set, smooth, round and lengthy bodies are the
principal features of this breed.</p>

<p>Beef consumers will find them in the front rank for yielding wholesome,
nourishing food, juicy, tender, and of the best flavor, free from all
unpalatable masses of fat or tallow. It is these favorable characteristics
which have gained such an excellent, and widespread reputation for the
Aberdeen-Angus cattle. The growing belief that the best breed of beeves is
the one that for a given quantity of food, and in the shortest time will
produce the greatest weight of nutritious food combined with the smallest
amount of bone, tallow, and other waste is going to make these cattle as
popular with our beef consumers and producers generally as they have been
with those who have long been familiar with their many superior
qualities.</p>

<hr class="c33" />

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Hogs"></a>Grass for Hogs.</h2>

<p>With plenty of milk and mill-feed to mix with the corn, good hogs may
be grown without grass. But with corn alone, the task of growing and
fattening a hog without grass costs more than the hog is worth.</p>

<p>To make hog-growing profitable to the farmer, he must have grass. In
the older States where the tame grasses are plenty, it is a very
thoughtless farmer who has not his hog pasture. But out here in Kansas and
Nebraska, where we have plenty of corn, but no grass, except the wild
varieties, the most enterprising of us are at our wits' ends. Hogs will
eat these wild grasses while tender in the spring, and, even without corn,
will grow long, tall, and wonderfully lean, and in the fall will fatten
much more readily than hogs grown on corn. But fattening the lean hogs
takes too much corn. We must have a grass that the hogs will relish, and
on which they will both grow and fatten. They will do this on clover,
orchard grass, bluegrass, and other tame grasses. But we have not got any
of these, nor do we know how to get them. Hundreds of bushels of tame
grass seeds are sold every spring by our implement dealers. A few have
succeeded in getting some grass, but nine out of ten lose their seed. We
either do not know how to grow it, or the seed is not good, or the soil is
too new. The truth, perhaps, lies a little in all three. Our agricultural
colleges are claiming to have success with these grasses, and their
experience would be of value to the farmers if these reports could ever
reach them. Not one farmer in a hundred ever sees them. I know of but one
farmer of sufficient political influence to receive these reports through
the mails. The rest of us can get them for the asking. But not many of us
know this, fewer know whom to ask, and still fewer ask. I do not know a
farmer that orders a single copy. Farmers, living about our county towns,
and doing their trading there, and having leisure enough to loaf about the
public offices, and curiosity enough to scratch through the dust-covered
piles of old papers and rubbish in the corner, are usually rewarded by
finding a copy of these valuable reports. But we, who live far away from
the county seat, do our farming without this aid, and mostly without any
knowledge of their existence. This looks like a lamentable state of
agricultural stupidity. Notwithstanding this dark picture we would all
read, and be greatly profited by these reports, if they were laid on our
tables.</p>

<p>If it pays to expend so much labor and money in preparing these reports
and sending them half way to the people, would it not be wise to expend a
little more and complete the journey, by making it the duty of the
assessor to leave a copy on every farmer's table? Compulsory
education.</p>

<p>As an explanation of much of the above, it must be remembered that we
are nearly all recently from the East, that we have brought with us our
Eastern experience, education, literature, and household gods; and that
not until we have tried things in our old Eastern ways and failed, do we
realize that we exist under a new and different state of things and slowly
begin to open our eyes to the existence of Western agricultural reports
and papers giving us the conditions on which the best results have been
obtained.</p>

<p>There will be more grass seed planted this spring than ever before, and
the farmers will be guided by the conditions on which the best successes
seem to have been obtained. But this seeding will not give us much grass
for this coming summer. What must we do? I write for our Western farmers
who have no clover, orchard grass, blue grass, but have in their
cultivated fields.</p>

<p class="center">CRAB GRASS.</p>

<p>This grass, the most troublesome weed of the West, smothering our
gardens and converting our growing corn-fields into dense meadows, makes
the best hog pasture in the world, while it lasts. Put hogs into a pasture
containing all the tame grasses, with one corner in crab grass, and the
last named grass will all be consumed before the other grasses are
touched.</p>

<p>Not only do they prefer it to any other grass, but on no grass will
they thrive and fatten so well. Last spring I fenced twelve acres of old
stalk ground well seeded to crab grass. With the first of June the field
was green, and from then until frost pastured sixty large hogs, which,
with one ear of corn each, morning and evening, became thoroughly fat.
These were the finest and cheapest hogs I ever grew.</p>

<p>This grass is in its glory from June till frosts. By sowing the ground
early in oats, this will pasture the hogs until June, when the crab grass
will occupy all the ground, and carry them through in splendid condition,
and fat them, with an ear of<a name= "fnanchor_k" id= "fnanchor_k"></a><a
href= "#footnote_k" class= "fnanchor">[jk]</a> corn morning and
evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Many of our readers may be
unfamiliar with the variety of grass spoken of by our correspondent. It is
known as crop grass, crab grass, wire grass, and crow's foot (<i>Eleusine
Indica</i>). Flint describes it as follows: Stems ascending, flattened,
branching at the base; spikes, two to five, greenish. It is an annual and
flowers through the season, growing from eight to fifteen inches high, and
forming a fine green carpeting in lawns and yards. It is indigenous in
Mississippi, Alabama, and adjoining States, and serves for hay, grazing,
and turning under as a fertilizer. It grows there with such luxuriance, in
many sections, as never to require sowing, and yields a good crop where
many of the more Northern grasses would fail.&mdash;[<span

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Stock_Farm"></a>A Stock Farm and Ranch.</h2>

<p>Some years ago Prof. J. B. Turner, of Jacksonville, Ill., whom almost
every reader of <span class="smcap">The Prairie Farmer</span> in days gone
by knows, personally, or by his writings, in company with one of his sons
conceived the idea of running an Illinois stock farm in connection with a
ranch in Texas. The young animals were to be reared on the cheap lands in
the latter State where care and attention amount to a trifle, and to ship
them North to finish them off for market on the blue grass and corn of the
Illinois farm. To carry out this purpose they purchased nearly 10,000
acres in Coleman county, Texas, and they converted 1,000 acres in a body
in Montgomery county, Illinois, into a home stock farm. Unfortunately,
just as all things were in readiness for extensive operations, the son
died, leaving the business to Prof. Turner, now nearly an octogenarian and
entirely unable to bear the burden thus forced upon him. As a consequence,
he desires to sell these large and desirable possessions, separate or
together, as purchasers may offer.</p>

<p>The Illinois farm is well fenced and in a high state of cultivation.
There are growing upon it more than 2,000 large evergreens, giving at once
protection to stock and beauty to the landscape. There are also 1,500
bearing fruit trees, a vineyard, and a large quantity of raspberries,
blackberries, currants, etc.</p>

<p>Besides a good farm-house, there is a large barn, in which there are
often fed at one time 150 head of horses, with plenty of room for each
animal; and an abundance of storage room in proportion for grain and hay.
Also a large sheep shed, the feeding capacity of which is 3,000 head. Also
a large hog house, conveniently divided into pens with bins for grain.
Other numerous out-buildings, granary, hay sheds, stock and hay scales,
etc., etc. There are on the farm twelve miles of Osage orange hedge, the
best kind of fence in the world, in perfect trim and full growth; and four
miles of good rail fence, dividing the farm off into conveniently sized
fields of forty, eighty and one hundred and sixty acres each, access to
which is easily obtained by means of gates which open from each field into
a private central road belonging to the farm, and directly connected with
the stock yards near the house, so that it is not necessary to pass over
other fields in the handling of stock. Stockmen will appreciate this
arrangement. Owing to its special advantages for handling stock, it has
become widely known as a "Model Stock Farm." The lands are all naturally
well drained; no flat or wet land, and by means of natural branches, which
run through every eighty acres, the whole farm is conveniently and easily
watered, by an unfailing supply. There are besides three large wind mills,
with connecting troughs for watering the stock yards and remotest field.
This supply of stock water has never failed. It is therefore specially
adapted for all kinds of stock raising, and is well stocked. It has on it
a fine drove of Hereford cattle and Norman horses, and is otherwise fully
equipped with all the recent improvements in farming implements. This farm
is only about fifty miles from St. Louis, Mo., two miles from a railroad
station, and six miles from Litchfield, Illinois. Besides its location
commercially, and its advantages for handling stock, this farm is in one
of the best wheat and fruit producing sections of Illinois, and has now on
it 200 acres of fine wheat.</p>

<p>The ranch in Texas consists of one body of 9,136 acres of choice land.
By means of an unfailing supply of living water the whole ranch is well
watered, and has besides a very large cistern. The soil is covered with
the Curly Mesquite grass, the richest and most nutritious native stock
grass known in Texas. There is also on the ranch a splendid growth of live
oak trees, the leaves of which remain green the year round, furnishing
shade in summer, and an ample protection for stock in winter.</p>

<p>There is on the ranch a large well built stone house, and also a fine
sheep shed, with bins for 5,000 bushels of grain. This shed is covered
with Florida Cypress shingles and affords protection for 2,000 head of
sheep, and can be used just as well for other kinds of stock. Here can be
bred and raised to maturity at a mere nominal cost, all kinds of cattle,
horses, mules, and other stock, no feed in winter being required beyond
the natural supply of grass. After the stock reaches maturity they can be
shipped to the Illinois Farm; and while all the cattle easily fatten in
Texas enough for the market, still as they are generally shipped to St.
Louis or Chicago, it costs but little more, and greatly increases the
profits, to first ship them to the Illinois Farm, and put them in prime
condition, besides being near the markets, and placing the owner in
position to take advantage of desirable prices at any time. With horses
and mules this is a special advantage readily apparent to every one.</p>

<p>It will be seen at once that any individual with capital, or a stock
company, or partnership of two or more men, could run this farm and ranch
together at a great profit. All the improvements on both being made solely
for convenience and profit and not anything expended for useless show.</p>

<p>I do not write this communication from any selfish motive, for I have
not a penny's worth of interest in either farm or ranch, but I want to let
people who are looking for stock farms know that here is one at hand such
as is seldom found, and at the same time to do my life-long friend and
yours a slight favor in return for the great and lasting benefits he has,
in the past, so freely conferred upon the farmers of the State and
country.</p>

<p>I know these lands can be bought far below their real value, and the
purchaser will secure a rare bargain. I presume the Professor will be glad
to correspond with parties, giving full particulars as to terms.</p>

<p>Saturday, March 15, I visited the herds of Messrs. Du Brouck, Schooley
and Fannce northeast of Effingham, Illinois, and carefully examined them
with Mr. F. F. Hunt, of the university, as they were reported affected
with foot-and-mouth disease. In each herd diseased cattle were found;
about 20 distinctly marked cases, a few others having symptoms. The
disease is unlike anything I have known, <span class="pagenum">[Pg
181]</span>but does not resemble foot-and-mouth disease as described by
any authority. Only the hind feet are affected, and these without
ulceration. In most cases "scouring" was first noticed, followed by
swelling above the hoofs. In the most severe cases, the skin cracked about
the pastern joint or at the coronet. In four cases one foot had come off.
Swelling of pastern and "scouring" were the only symptoms in several
cases. The mouth and udders were healthful; appetites good. In one case
there was slight vesicle on nostril and slight inflammation of gum. Some
animals in contact with diseased ones for weeks remained healthful. Others
were attacked after five weeks' isolation. The most marked cases were of
eight to ten weeks standing. But one animal had died.</p>

<p>What we saw is not foot and mouth disease as known abroad, nor is the
contagious character of the disease proven from the cases in these
herds.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Cheese"></a>Camembert Cheese.</h2>

<p>The Camembert is one of the variety of French cheeses that find ready
sale in England at high prices. Mr. Jenkins describes the process of
making this cheese in a late number of the Journal of the Royal
Agricultural Society of England which information we find condensed in the
Dublin Farmer's Gazette:</p>

<p>The cows are milked three times a day, at 4.30 and 11.30 a. m., and at
6 p. m. In most dairies the evening's milk is highly skimmed in the
morning, butter being made from the cream, and the milk divided into two
portions one of which is added to the morning's and the other to the
midday's milking. The mixture is immediately put into earthen<a name=
"fnanchor_m" id= "fnanchor_m"></a><a href= "#footnote_m" class=
"fnanchor">[m]</a> vessels holding twelve to fifteen gallons each, and
after it has been raised to the temperature of about 86 deg. Fahr., a
sufficient quantity of rennet is added to make the curd fit to be
transferred to the cheese moulds in three or four hours, or, perhaps, a
longer interval in winter. The mixture of the rennet with the milk is
insured by gentle stirring, and the pots are then covered with a square
board. The curd is ready for removal when it does not adhere to the back
of the finger placed gently upon it, and when the liquid that runs from
the fingers is as nearly as possible colorless. The curd is transferred,
without breaking it more than can be avoided, to perforated moulds four
inches in diameter. The moulds are placed on reed mats resting on slightly
inclined slabs, made of slate, cement, or other hard material, and having
a gutter near the outer edge. The curd remains in the moulds twenty-four
or even forty-eight hours, according to the season, being turned upside
down after twelve or twenty-four hours; that is, when sufficiently drained
at the bottom. After turning the face of the cheese, the inside of<a name=
"fnanchor_n" id= "fnanchor_n"></a><a href= "#footnote_n" class=
"fnanchor">[n]</a> the mould is sprinkled with salt, and twelve hours
afterward the opposite face and the rim of the cheeses are treated in the
same way. The cheeses are then placed on movable shelves round the walls
of the dairy for a day or two, after which the curing process commences by
the cheeses being transferred to the "drying-room," and there placed on
shelves made of narrow strips of wood with narrow intervals between them,
or of ordinary planks with reed mats or clean rye straw. Here the greatest
ingenuity is exerted to secure as dry an atmosphere and as equable a
temperature as possible&mdash;the windows being numerous and small, and
fitted with glass, to exclude air, but not light, when the glass is shut,
with a wooden shutter to exclude both light and air; and with wire gauze
to admit light and air, and exclude flies and winged insects, which are
troublesome to the makers of soft cheese.</p>

<p>The cheeses are turned at first once a day, and afterward every second
day, unless in damp weather, when daily turning is absolutely necessary.
In three or four days after the cheeses are placed in the drying-room they
become speckled; in another week they are covered with a thick crop of
white mold, which by degrees deepens to a dark yellow, the outside of the
cheese becoming less and less sticky. At the end of about a month, when
the cheese no longer sticks to the fingers, it is taken to the finishing
room, where light is nearly excluded, and the atmosphere is kept very
still and slightly damp. Here they remain three or four weeks, being
turned every day or every second day, according to the season, and
carefully examined periodically. When ready for market&mdash;that is to
say, in winter, when ripe, and in summer, when half ripe&mdash;they are
made up in packets of six, by means of straw and paper, with great skill
and neatness.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Butter"></a>Few Words and More Butter.</h2>

<p>The Wisconsin Dairymen's Association last year offered prizes for the
best essays on butter-making, the essays not to exceed 250 words.
Competition was active, and many valuable little treatises was the result.
The first prize was won by D. W. Curtis, of Fort Atkinson, and reads as
follows. We commend it to all butter-makers and to all writers of essays
as a model of the boiled-down essence of brevity:</p>

<p class="center">COWS.</p>

<p>Select cows rich in butter-making qualities.</p>

<p class="center">FEED.</p>

<p>Pastures should be dry, free from slough-holes, well seeded with
different kinds of tame grasses, so that good feed is assured. If timothy
or clover, cut early and cure properly. Feed corn, stalks, pumpkins,
ensilage and plenty of vegetables in winter.</p>

<p class="center">GRAIN.</p>

<p>Corn and oats, corn and bran, oil meal in small quantities.</p>

<p class="center">WATER.</p>

<p>Let cows drink only such water as you would yourself.</p>

<p class="center">CARE OF COWS.</p>

<p>Gentleness and cleanliness.</p>

<p class="center">MILKING.</p>

<p>Brush the udder to free it from impurities. Milk in a clean barn, well
ventilated, quickly, cheerfully, with clean hands and pail. Seldom change
milkers.</p>

<p class="center">CARE OF MILK.</p>

<p>Strain while warm; submerge in water 48 degrees. Open setting 60
degrees.</p>

<p class="center">SKIMMING.</p>

<p>Skim at twelve hours; at twenty-four hours.</p>

<p class="center">CARE OF CREAM.</p>

<p>Care must be exercised to ripen cream by frequent stirrings, keeping at
60 degrees until slightly sour.</p>

<p class="center">UTENSILS.</p>

<p>Better have one cow less than be without a thermometer. Churns without
inside fixtures. Lever butter worker. Keep sweet and clean.</p>

<p class="center">CHURNING.</p>

<p>Stir the cream thoroughly; temper to 60 degrees; warm or cool with
water. Churn immediately when properly soured, slowly at first, with
regular motion, in 40 to 60 minutes. When butter is formed in granules the
size of wheat kernels, draw off the buttermilk; wash with cold water and
brine until no trace of buttermilk is left.</p>

<p class="center">WORKING AND SALTING.</p>

<p>Let the water drain out; weigh the butter; salt, one ounce to the
pound; sift salt on the butter, and work with lever worker. Set away two
to four hours; lightly re-work and pack.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A machine</span> that can take hay, corn fodder,
grass, and grain and manufacture them into good, rich milk at the rate of
a quart per hour for every hour in the twenty-four, is a valuable one and
should be well cared for. There are machines&mdash;cows&mdash;which have
done this. There are many thousands of them that will come well up to this
figure for several months in the year, and which will, besides, through
another system of organisms, turn out a calf every year to perpetuate the
race of machines. Man has it in his power to increase the capacity of the
cow for milk and the milk for cream. He must furnish the motive power, the
belts, and the oil in the form of proper food, shelter, and kindly
treatment. By withholding these he throws the entire machinery out of gear
and robs himself.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Vet_Foot"></a>Symptoms of Foot-and-Mouth
Disease.</h2>

<p>This disease, which is one of the most easily transmitted of contagious
and infectious diseases of domestic animals, is characterized by the
appearance of vesicles or small bladders on the mucous surfaces and those
parts of the skin uncovered by hair, such as in the mouth, on the gums and
palate, on the tongue, and the internal surface of the lips and cheeks; on
the surface of the udder and teats, and between the claws. The disease
passes through four different stages or periods; but for present purposes
it will be sufficient to merely mention the most prominent of the
successive changes and appearances, as they occur to the ordinary
observer. The incubatory stage, or the time between contamination and the
development of the disease, is very short (from twenty-four hours to one
or two weeks), and the disease is ushered in by the general symptoms of
fever, such as shivering, increased temperature, staring coat, dry muzzle,
dullness and loss of appetite. The animals seek seclusion, preferably in
sheltered places, where they assume a crouched position, or lie down, and
there is more or less stiffness and unwillingness to move. The mouth
becomes hot and inflamed looking, and covered with slime, the breath
fetid; the animal grinds the teeth, smacks with mouth, and has difficulty
in swallowing. There is more or less tenderness of feet and lameness, and
in cows the udder becomes red and tender, the teats swollen, and they
refuse to be milked. Depending upon the intensity of the fever and the
extent to which the udder is affected, the milk secretion will be more or
less diminished, or entirely suspended; but throughout the disease the
quality or constituents of the milk become materially altered; its color
changes to a yellow; it has a tendency to rapid decomposition, and
possesses virulent properties. Soon yellowish-white blisters, of various
sizes, from that of a small pea to a small hickory nut, appear on the
mucous surface within the mouth, and which blisters often in the course of
development become confluent or coalesce. They generally break within two
to three days, and leave bright red, uneven, and ragged sores or ulcers,
to the edges of which adheres shreds of detached epithelial tissue. The
animal now constantly moves the tongue and smacks the mouth, while more or
less copious and viscid saliva continually dribbles from the mouth. The
lameness increases in proportion as the feet are affected, and if the fore
feet are most affected, the animal walks much like a floundered horse,
with the hinder limbs advanced far under the body, and with arched back.
The coronet of the claws, especially toward the heels, becomes swollen,
hot, and tender, causing the animal to lie down most of the time. The
blisters, which appear at the interdigital space of the claws, and
especially at the heels, break in the course of a day and discharge a
thick, straw-colored fluid; the ulcers, which are of intensely red or
scarlet color, soon become covered with exudating lymph, which dries and
forms scabs. On the udder, the blisters appear more or less scattered and
variable, and they are most numerous at the base and on the teats.
Ordinarily, the disease terminates in two or three weeks, while the
animal, which during its progress refuses to partake of any other than
sloppy food, gradually regains strength and flesh, and the udder resumes
its normal functions. The mortality at times has proved very great in this
disease when it has appeared with unusual virulency.</p>

<hr class="c33" />

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Shyness"></a>Shyness and Timidity.</h2>

<p>In common "horse language," these propensities are confounded one with
the other or else no proper and right distinction is made between them. A
horse may be timid without being shy, though he can hardly be said to be
shy without being timid. Young horses in their breaking are timid,
frightened at every fresh or strange object they see. They stand gazing
and staring at objects they have not seen before, fearful to approach
them; but they do not run away from, or shy at them; on the contrary, the
moment they are convinced there is nothing hurtful in them, they refuse
not to approach or even trample upon them. This the shy horse will not do.
He can not be persuaded to turn toward or even to look at the object he
shies at; much less to approach it.</p>

<p>Timid horses, through usage and experience, get the better of their
timidity, and in time become very opposite to fearful; but shy horses,
unless worked down to fatigue and broken-spiritedness, rarely forget their
old sins. The best way to treat them is to work them, day by day,
moderately for hours together, taking no notice whatever of their shying
tricks, neither caressing nor chastising them, and on no account whatever
endeavoring to turn their heads either towards or away from the objects
shied at.</p>

<hr class="c33" />

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Glanders"></a>Glanders.</h2>

<p>With a view of shedding light on the important question of the
contagiousness of glanders, we will mention the following deductions from
facts brought forth by our own experience.</p>

<p>1. That farcy and glanders, which constitute the same disease, are
propagable through the medium of stabling, and this we believe to be the
more usual way in which the disease is communicated from horse to
horse.</p>

<p>2. That infected stabling may harbor and retain the infection for
months, or even years; and though, by thoroughly cleansing and making use
of certain disinfecting means, the contagion may probably be destroyed, it
would not perhaps be wise to occupy such stables <i>immediately</i> after
such supposed or alleged disinfection.</p>

<p>3. That virus (or poison of glanders) may lie for months in a state of
incubation in the horse's constitution, before the disease breaks out. We
have had the most indubitable evidence of its lurking in one horse's
system for the space of fifteen weeks.</p>

<p>4. That when a stud or stable of horses becomes contaminated, the
disease often makes fearful ravages among them before it quits them; and
it is only after a period of several months' exemption from all disease of
the kind that a clean bill of health can be safely rendered.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Sand_Mulching"></a>Sand Mulching of Orchard
Trees.</h2>

<p>In <span class="smcap">The Prairie Farmer</span> I notice the
interesting note of "O." of Sheboygan Falls, Wis., on the apparent benefit
resulting from sand and manure mulching of pear trees.</p>

<p>In the very near future I expect to see much of this kind of work done
by commercial orchardists. Already we have many trees in Iowa mulched with
sand.</p>

<p>I wish now to draw attention to the fact that on the rich black prairie
soils west of Saratov&mdash;about five hundred miles southeast of
Moscow&mdash;every tree in the profitable commercial orchards is mulched
with pure river sand. The crown of the tree when planted is placed about
six inches lower than usual with us in a sort of basin, about sixteen feet
across. This basin is then filled in with sand so that in the center,
where the tree stands, it is three or four inches higher than the general
level of the soil. The spaces between these slight depressions filled with
sand are seeded down to grass, which is not cut, but at time of fruit
gathering is flattened by brushing to make a soft bed for the dropping
fruit and for a winter mulch.</p>

<p>The close observer will not fail to notice good reasons for this
treatment. (1.) The sand mulch maintains an even temperature and moisture
of the surface roots and soil and prevents a rapid evaporation of the
moisture coming up by capillary attraction from the sub soil.</p>

<p>(2.) The soil under the sand will not freeze as deeply as on exposed
surfaces, and we were told that it would not freeze as deeply by two feet
or more as under the tramped grass in the interspaces.</p>

<p>(3.) With the light colored sand about the trees, and grass between,
the lower beds of air among the trees would not be as hot by several
degrees as the exposed surface, even when the soil was light colored
clay.</p>

<p>(4.) A bed of sand around the trunks of the trees will close in with
the movement of the top by the summer and autumn winds, thus avoiding the
serious damage often resulting from the swaying of the trunk making an
opening in the soil for water to settle and freeze.</p>

<p>Still another use is made of this sand in very dry seasons, which as
with us would often fail to carry the fruit to perfection. On the upper
side of large commercial orchards, large cisterns are constructed which
are filled by a small steam pump. When it is decided that watering is
needed the sand is drawn out, making a sort of circus ring around the
trees which is run full of water by putting on an extra length of V
spouting for each tree. When one row is finished the conductors are passed
over to next row as needed. To water an orchard of 1,200 trees&mdash;after
the handy fixtures are once provided&mdash;seems but a small task. After
the water settles away, the sand is returned to its place.</p>

<p>In the Province of Saratov we saw orchards with and without the sand,
and with and without the watering. We did not need to ask if the
systematic management paid. The great crops of smooth apples and pears,
and the long lived and perfect trees on the mulched and watered orchards
told the whole story of the needs of trees planted on black soil on an
open plain subject to extreme variations as to moisture and temperature of
air and soil.</p>

2.</h2>

<p>The mere "experience" of an individual, whether as a doctor of
medicine, horticulture, or agriculture&mdash;however extensive, is
comparatively worthless. Indeed the million "demonstrate it to be
mischievous, judging from the success of quacks and empyrics as to money.
An unlimited number of facts and certificates prove nothing, either as to
cause or remedy."</p>

<p>Sir Isaac Newton's corpuscular theory "explained all the phenomena of
light, except one," and he actually assumed, for it "fits." Nevertheless
it will ever remain the most thinkable mode of teaching the laws of light,
and it is not probable that any more than this will ever be accomplished
as to any natural science&mdash;if that can be called science about which
we must admit that "it is not so; but it is as if it were so."</p>

<p>Of more than 300 "Osband Summer" which I grafted on the Anger quince
successfully, one remains, and this one was transplanted after they had
fruited in a clay soil, to the same sort of soil between "the old
standard" and a stable, both of which have occupied the same locality and
within twenty yards, during much more than fifty years of my own
observation&mdash;this "Osband Summer" flourishes. It has borne fruit in
its present site, but grew so rapidly last year that the blossoms aborted
thus illustrating the large proportion of vital force necessary to the
production of fruit, as the site has a perennial supply of manure from the
old stable. A number of standard trees, of the same variety, developed
beautifully until they attained twenty or thirty feet, but then succumbed
to the blight, after the first effort at fruiting. So also the Beurre
Clairgean etc., etc. Their exposure to the same influences, and their
growth during several years did not occasion the blight, but the debility
which must inevitably attend fruiting seems the most prolific cause.</p>

<p>All the phenomena of pear blight can be accounted for, and we are
greatly encouraged in protecting the trees therefrom if, we assume, it is
only the result of weakness and deficient vitality; if so, as in
epidemics, all the pear trees may be poisoned or ergotized, but only the
weakest succumb; and perhaps this debility may be confined to one limb.
The practical value of this view is manifest, as it is impracticable to
avoid using the same knife, and remove every blighted leaf from the
orchard. Moreover, if the limb is a large one, its prompt removal shocks
the vitality of the whole tree<a name= "fnanchor_1" id=
"fnanchor_1"></a><a href= "#footnote_1" class= "fnanchor">[1]</a> and thus
renders other parts more vulnerable. On the contrary view, the limb may be
allowed to drop by natural process, precisely as all trees in a forest
shed their lower limbs, leaving hardly a cicatrice or scar, and this may
be insured at any season by a cord of hemp twine, firmly bound around the
limb. The inevitable strangulation, and the healing of the stump (without
the mycelium of fungi which the knife or saw inevitably propagates by
exposing a denuded surface, if not more directly) proceed more rapidly
than the natural slough of limbs by starvation. Moreover the fruit may
mature on such limbs during their strangulation, as this may not be
perfected before the subsequent winter.</p>

<p>The next practical result of my view is the fundamental importance of
all those means which are calculated to husband the vital force of the
tree during its first effort to fruit; one of these is the use of a soil
that will not produce more than twenty bushels of corn without manure,
thus a large proportion of the setts will be aborted, but one half of what
remains should be removed, and subsequently the area beneath the limbs
should have a wheelbarrow of good compost.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_1" id="footnote_1"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_1">[1]</a>
<span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;The shock as to vital force is
demonstrated by the fact that when young trees are not trimmed at all
their girth increases more rapidly, and they bear fruit sooner. Moreover,
when old trees are severely pruned (though not half the proportion of wood
is removed) they fail to bear during the next year. I find that a hemp
cord about the size of the stem of a tobacco pipe (one-fourth inch
diameter) will soon become imbedded in the bark if firmly tied around a
limb, and perhaps this size is more efficient than a thicker cord.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Black_Walnut"></a>The Black Walnut.</h2>

<p>The black walnut is without doubt the most valuable tree we have for
the rich lands of the "corn belt," West, and one which is very easily
grown everywhere if the farmer will only learn how to get it started. How
few we see growing on our prairies. Why? Simply because to have it we must
grow it from the nuts. It is nearly impossible to transplant black walnut
trees of any size and have them live; although it is a fact that whenever
a non-professional attempts to grow them from the nuts he is almost sure
to fail, it is also a fact that there is no tree that is more easily grown
from the seed than this, if we only know how to do it.</p>

<p>It is my purpose in this note to tell how to do it, and also how not to
do it.</p>

<p>In the first instance we will suppose a man lives where he can gather
the nuts in the woods. When the nuts begin to fall let him plow deeply the
plot of ground he wishes to plant and furrow it off three or four inches
deep, the distance apart he wishes his rows to be. He will then go to the
woods and gather what nuts he wishes to plant, and plant them at once,
just as they come from the tree, covering them just out of sight in the
furrows. This is all there is of it; simple, is it not? But it will not do
to gather a great wagon box full, and let them stand in it until they
heat, or to throw them in a great heap on the ground and let them lay
there until they heat. It will not do, either, to hull them and let them
lay in the sun a week or two, or hull them, dry them and keep them until
spring, and then plant; none of these plans will do if you want trees. Of
course if the nuts are hulled and planted at once they will grow; but this
hulling is entirely unnecessary. Besides, the hulls seem to act as a
special manure for the young seedlings, causing them to grow more
vigorously.</p>

<p>Next, we will suppose one wishes to plant walnuts where they can not be
had from the woods, but must be shipped in. There seems to be only one
plan by which this can be done safely every time, which is as follows:
Gather the nuts as they fall from the trees&mdash;of course when they
begin to fall naturally all may be shaken down at once&mdash;and spread
them not over a foot deep, on the bare ground under the shade of trees.
Cover out of sight with straw or leaves, with some sticks to hold in place
called a "rot heap;" then after they are frozen and will stay so, they may
be shipped in bags, boxes, barrels, or in bulk by the car-load, and then,
again, placed in "rot heaps," as above, until so early in the spring as
the soil is in workable condition. Then plant as directed in the fall,
except the soil should be firmly packed around the nuts. Keep free from
weeds by good cultivation, and in due time you will have a splendid
grove.</p>

<p>There was an immense crop of walnuts in this district last fall, and
thousands of bushels were put up carefully, in this way, all ready for
shipment before the weather became warm; many more thousands were planted
to grow seedlings from, for, notwithstanding the walnut transplants poorly
when of considerable size, the one year seedlings transplant with as
little loss as the average trees.</p>

<p>There is no tree better adapted for planting to secure timber claims
with than the black walnut, and none more valuable when the timber is
grown. For this purpose the land should be plowed deeply, then harrowed to
fineness and firmness, and furrowed out in rows four, six, eight, or ten
feet apart. The nuts may then be planted as directed. It is best to plant
thickly in the rows, then if too thick they can be thinned out,
transplanting the thinnings, or selling them to the neighbors. They should
be thoroughly cultivated, until large enough to shade the ground, and
thinned out as necessary as they grow larger. A walnut grove thoroughly
cultivated the first ten years will grow at least twenty feet high, while
one not cultivated at all would only grow two to three feet in that
time.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Current_Topics"></a>Notes on Current
Topics.</h2>

<p class="center">ARBOR DAY.</p>

<p>Why can not Illinois have an Arbor Day as well as Nebraska, or any
other State. There ought to be ten millions of trees planted the coming
spring within its borders&mdash;saying nothing of orchard trees&mdash;by
the roadside, on lawns, for shade, for wind breaks, for shelter, for
mechanical purposes, and for climatic amelioration. Nearly all our towns
and villages need more trees along the streets or in parks; thousands of
our farms are suffering for them; hundreds of cemeteries would be
beautified by them, and numberless homes would be rendered more pleasant
and homelike by an addition of one, two, or a dozen, to their bleak
places. Can not <span class="smcap">The Prairie Farmer</span> start a boom
that will lead to the establishment of an Arbor Day all over the State?
Why not? There is yet time.</p>

<p class="center">HOT-BEDS.</p>

<p>For the benefit of those who can not command the usual appliances for
hot-beds, I will say that they can be made so as to answer a good purpose
very cheaply. Take a nice sunny spot that is covered with a sod, if to be
had. Dig off the sod in squares and pile them carefully on the north side
and the ends of the pit, to form the sides of the bed, with a proper
slope. The soil thrown out from the bottom may be banked up against the
sods as a protection. After the bed is finished, the whole may be covered
with boards, to turn the water off. These answer in the place of glass
frames. As the main use for a hot-bed is to secure bottom heat, very good
results can be obtained in these cheaply constructed affairs. After the
seeds are up, and when the weather will permit, the boards must be removed
to give light and air&mdash;but replaced at night and before a rain. Of
course, where large quantities of plants are to be grown, of tender as
well as hardy sorts, it would be better and safer to go to the expense of
board frames and glass for covering.</p>

<p class="center">DON'T DO IT.</p>

<p>Of course, all the peach trees, and many of the other stone fruits, and
most of the blackberry and raspberry plants, will show discoloration of
wood when the spring opens&mdash;so much so that many will pronounce them
destroyed, and will proceed to cut them away. Don't do it. Peaches have
often been thus injured, and by judicious handling saved to bear crops for
years afterward. But they will need to be thoroughly cut back. Trees of
six or seven years old I have cut down so as to divest them of nearly all
their heads, when those heads seemed badly killed, and had them throw out
new heads, that made large growth and bore good crops the following
season. Cut them back judiciously, and feed them well, but don't destroy
them. And so with the berry plants. Wait and see, before you destroy.</p>

<p class="center">PEARS FROM RUSSIA.</p>

<p>No one who reads Prof. Budd's articles on Russian Pears, can fail to be
interested and struck with the prospect of future successful pear culture
in the United States. It is highly probable that Russia is yet to give us
a class of that fruit that will withstand the rigors of our climate. But
how is this to be accomplished? Individual enterprise can, and doubtless
will, accomplish much in that direction; but the object seems to me to be
of sufficient importance to justify State or National action. The great
State of Illinois might possibly add millions to her resources by giving
material aid in the furtherance of this purpose&mdash;and a liberal
expenditure by the General Government, through the Department of
Agriculture, or the American Pomological Society, would be more usefully
applied than many other large sums annually voted. At all events, another
season of fruitage ought not to be allowed to pass without some concerted
action for the purpose of testing the question.</p>

<p>Some of our strongest nurserymen will likely be moving in the work, but
that will not be enough. The propagator of that fruit, however, who will
succeed in procuring from the European regions a variety of pears that
will fill the bill required by the necessities of our soil and climate,
has a fortune at his command.</p>

<p class="center">OLD WINTER</p>

<p>lingers in the lap of spring, truly, this year of grace, 1884. Here it
is the 10th of March, and for over one hundred days we have had
winter&mdash;winter; but very few real mild and bright days, such as we
had "when I was a boy." The Mississippi is frozen over still, with no
signs of breaking up, and men, women, and children are sighing for
sunshine and showers, and daisies and violets. The wood and coal bills
have been enormous; the pigs squeal in the open pens, and cattle roam, as
usual, shivering in the lanes and along the streets. The song of a robin
to-morrow morning would be a joyous sound to hear.<a name= "fnanchor_p"

<p>Tree-worship among the ancients had a most important influence on the
preservation of forests in circumscribed places. Beautiful groves, which
would otherwise have been sacrificed on the altar of immediate utility,
were preserved by the religious respect for trees.&mdash;Milwaukee

<p>F. K. Ph&oelig;nix. "Small trees have larger roots in proportion, (2)
they cost less, (3) expressage of freight is less&mdash;expressing small

speedy, (4) less labor handling, digging holes, etc., (5) less exposed to
high winds which loosen roots, and kill many transplanted trees, (6)

care in, say five years, they will overtake the common larger sized trees.
Without good care, better not plant any size."</p>

<p>The coming currant is Fay's Prolific. It originated with Lincoln Fay,
of Chautauqua county, N. Y. For many years he endeavored to raise a
currant that would combine the size of the Cherry currant with the
productiveness of the Victoria. To this end he fertilized one with the
pollen of the other, and raised some thousands of seedlings, from out of
which he selected this as the one that most nearly realized his desires.
It is now sixteen years since this seedling was obtained. For some eight
or nine years Mr. Fay tested this variety by the side of all the sorts in
cultivation, until becoming convinced of its superiority in several
particulars over any of these, he planted it extensively for his own
marketing.</p>

<p>At a late meeting of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, the
currant worm came in for a good deal of talk. Mr. Satterthwaite said that
hellebore, as we have often printed, was the most effectual "remedy." He
mixed it with water and applied it with a brush or whisk of straw. If not
washed off by rain for twenty-four hours and used every year, the worms
were easily got rid of. Mr. Saunders, Superintendent of the Government
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 183]</span>Gardens at Washington, and a
gentleman thoroughly conversant with every branch of horticulture, said
that there was nothing so effectual with insects as London purple, and,
though equally poisonous as Paris green, was much cheaper. Tobacco stems
and refuse have also been found of great value in fruit culture.
Pyrethrum, he said, would also kill all sorts of leaf-eating insects; it
is now largely cultivated in California, and is hardy at least as far
north as Washington.</p>

careful ripening in the house. Don't understand me to say that Kieffer is
"best of all." But here it is the most profitable for market that I know
of, as this is not a pear country, as are portions of New York State. As
we go further south the Kieffer seems to improve, and I think Mr.
Berckmans, of Georgia, will give it a good name with him. Yes, the Kieffer
will command a higher price in Philadelphia than any other pear, and we
think some people there know what good fruit is. Don't imagine I have any
axe on the grindstone in this matter; pecuniarily the Kieffer is no more
to me than the Bartlett or dozens of other varieties.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Floriculture"></a>Some New Plants.</h2>

<p class="center">ABUTILON THOMSONII PLENA.</p>

<p>It is one of the peculiarities of plant culture, that after a certain
number of years of cultivation, any plant having the properties of
sporting freely, that is, changing greatly from the original wild
character of the plant, will become double. In most cases it first arises
from seed, but with the plant under notice it appears that it was what is
called a bud variation, that is, that from some freak of a particular
branch of a plant of the well-known A. Thomsonii, the ordinary single
flowers were found to be double. This happening on a plant under the eye
of a professional florist was taken off the plant and rooted, and at once
became its established character. This phenomena of variation being
"fixed" by separate propagation, is by no means rare, and not a few of our
choice fruits, flowers, and vegetables had their origin by the same means.
It remains to be seen whether in this case it will be of much value except
as a curiosity, it having precisely the same leaf markings as the
original, which are a very distinct yellow mottling of the leaf in a field
of green, and for which the plant is valuable alone, the flowers being
quite of a secondary character. The flowers are said to be perfectly
double, resembling in form a double hollyhock, color deep orange, shaded
and streaked with crimson. This is the first year it has been sent out,
and we shall not be surprised if it is soon followed by others, for
usually, when the "double" condition of things has arrived no one has a
monopoly of the curiosity.</p>

<p class="center">ALTERNANTHERA AUREA NANA.</p>

<p>This is a charming new plant of decided merit to the carpet style of
bedding or edging, being very compact in growth, easily kept to a line of
the finest character, and producing what is of great importance in the
summer, a line of golden yellow. At times the old kind, A. aurea, would
come very good, but more often it had far too much of a green shade to
furnish the contrast sought after, and, as a result, failed to bring out
the effect the planter studied to produce. It is a fitting companion to A.
amabilis, A. paronychioides, and A. versicolor, and will be hailed with
delight by our park florists and other scientific planters.</p>

<p class="center">BOUVARDIA THOMAS MEEHAN.</p>

<p>Here we have a double scarlet bouvardia from the same raisers, Nanz and
Neuner, that astonished the floral world a few years back, with the double
white B. Alfred Neuner. This new addition, unlike the old, which was
another "bud variation," was secured by a cross between the old B.
leiantha, scarlet with a single flower, and Alfred Neuner, double white.
If this is the real origin of the kind, which we somewhat doubt, for if
our theory is correct, that a certain amount of cultivation predisposes to
double variation, then it is not necessary to cross the double, which in
fact can not be done with a perfectly double flower&mdash;the organs of
fructification being wanting with that of a single and seed-producing
kind, to account for the origin of a new double.</p>

<p>As is well known the old leiantha is one of the best scarlets yet, and
this new candidate for favor is said to unite the brilliant color and
profuse blooming qualities of the old favorite B. leiantha with the
perfect double flowers of B. Alfred Neuner.</p>

<p>There are now of this class of plants the three colors&mdash;white,
scarlet, and pink&mdash;in double as well as single; for instance, a pink
President Garfield sported from and was "fixed" from the white A. Neuner,
a year or two ago.</p>

<p class="center">STATICE SUWOROWII REGAL.</p>

<p>In this we have a right regal plant. We first heard of it from the
German catalogues, early in the past winter. This plant is now offered for
sale by the florists of this country. Its description from the catalogues
is as follows: "One of the finest novelties in the list of showy annuals
lately introduced. Its branching flower spikes, of a very bright rose,
with a crimson shade, appear successively from ten to fifteen on each
plant, and measure, each, fully fifteen to eighteen inches in height<a
name= "fnanchor_q" id= "fnanchor_q"></a><a href= "#footnote_q" class=
"fnanchor">[q]</a>, and from one-half to one inch in breadth; the foliage,
laying flat on the ground, is comparatively small, and completely hidden
by the numerous flower spikes, each leaf being five inches long, and from
one-half to two inches broad, undulated and glaucous. It is constantly in
bloom during the summer and autumn, and when in full bloom is a truly
magnificent sight, being one mass of flowers." This class of plants are
great favorites, and we should judge by the colored flowers and
description that this variety is a decided novelty.</p>

<p class="center">TEA ROSES, WHITE BON SILENE.</p>

<p>This is another new aspirant for favor, and comes out with the high
sounding character of being in a white what the old Bon Silene is as a red
winter tea rose. The description from the catalogue is: "The buds are
larger and more double than its parent (the red B. S.) and will produce
more flower buds than any other white rose in cultivation."</p>

<p>It was raised by Francis Morat, of Louisville, Ky., four years ago; it
is also a "sport," and from the old B. silene. Should it retain the good
flowering qualities, fragrance, and substance of the original kind, with a
pure white bud, it will very soon work its way into popular favor. Usually
a white variation has not the vitality that its colored progenitor had, so
that we say, wait and see.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Its Good and Bad Members&mdash;The Remarkable
Experiences of a Close Observer of Its Workings During a Long Residence at
Washington.</b></p>

<p class="center">[<i>Correspondence Rochester Democrat.</i>]</p>

<p>No city upon the American continent has a larger floating population
than Washington. It is estimated that during the sessions of Congress
twenty-five thousand people, whose homes are in various parts of this and
other countries, make this city their place of residence. Some come here,
attracted by the advantages the city offers for making the acquaintance of
public men; others have various claims which they wish to present, while
the great majority gather here, as crows flock to the carrion, for the
sole purpose of getting a morsel at the public crib. The latter class, as
a general thing, originate the many schemes which terminate in vicious
bills, all of which are either directed at the public treasury or toward
that revenue which the black-mailing of corporations or private
enterprises may bring.</p>

<p>While walking down Pennsylvania avenue the other day I met Mr. William
M. Ashley, formerly of your city, whose long residence here has made him
unusually well acquainted with the operations of the lobby.</p>

<p>Having made my wants in this particular direction known, in answer to
an interrogative, Mr. Ashley said:</p>

<p>"Yes, during my residence here I have become well acquainted with the
workings of the 'Third House,' as it is termed, and could tell you of
numerous jobs, which, like the 'Heathen Chinee,' are peculiar."</p>

<p>"You do not regard the lobby, as a body, vicious, do you?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily so, there are good and bad men comprising that body;
yet there have been times when it must be admitted that the combined power
of the 'Third House' has overridden the will of the people. The bad
influence of the lobby can be seen in the numerous blood-bills that are
introduced at every session."</p>

<p>"But how can these be discovered?"</p>

<p>"Easily enough, to the person who has made the thing a study. I can
detect them at a glance."</p>

<p>"Tell me, to what bills do you refer?"</p>

<p>"Well, take the annual gas bills, for instance. They are introduced for
the purpose of bleeding the Washington Gas Light company. They usually
result in an investigating committee which never amounts to anything more
than a draft upon the public treasury for the expenses of the
investigation. Another squeeze is the <i>abattoir</i> bills, as they are
called. These, of course, are fought by the butchers and market-men. The
first attempt to force a bill of this description was in 1877, when a
prominent Washington politician offered a fabulous sum for the
franchise."</p>

<p>"Anything else in this line that you think of, Mr. Ashley?"</p>

<p>"Yes, there's the job to reclaim the Potomac flats, which, had it
become a law, would have resulted in an enormous steal. The work is now
being done by the Government itself, and will rid the place of that
malarial atmosphere of which we hear so much outside the city."</p>

<p>"During your residence here have you experienced the bad results of
living in this climate?"</p>

<p>"Well, while I have not at all times enjoyed good health, I am certain
that the difficulty which laid me up so long was not malarial. It was
something that had troubled me for years. A shooting, stinging pain that
at times attacked different parts of my body. One day my right arm and leg
would torture me with pain, there would be great redness, heat and
swelling of the parts; and perhaps the next day the left arm and leg would
be similarly affected. Then again it would locate in some particular part
of my body and produce a tenderness which would well nigh drive me
frantic. There would be weeks at a time that I would be afflicted with an
intermitting kind of pain that would come on every afternoon and leave me
comparatively free from suffering during the balance of the twenty-four
hours. Then I would have terrible paroxysms of pain coming on at any time
during the day or night when I would be obliged to lie upon my back for
hours and keep as motionless as possible. Every time I attempted to move a
chilly sensation would pass over my body, or I would faint from hot
flashes. I suffered from a spasmodic contraction of the muscles and a
soreness of the back and bowels, and even my eyeballs become sore and
distressed me greatly whenever I wiped my face. I became ill-tempered,
peevish, fretful, irritable and desperately despondent."</p>

<p>"Of course you consulted the doctors regarding your difficulty?"</p>

<p>"Consulted them? well I should say I did. Some told me I had neuralgia;
others that I had inflammatory rheumatism, for which there was no cure,
that I would be afflicted all my life, and that time alone would mitigate
my sufferings."</p>

<p>"But didn't they try to relieve your miseries?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they vomited and physicked me, blistered and bled me, plastered
and oiled me, sweat, steamed, and everything but froze me, but without
avail."</p>

<p>"But how did you finally recover?"</p>

<p>"I had a friend living in Michigan who had been afflicted in a similar
way and had been cured. He wrote me regarding his recovery and advised me
to try the remedy which cured him. I procured a bottle and commenced its
use, taking a teaspoonful after each meal and at bed-time. I had used it
about a week when I noticed a decrease of the soreness of the joints and a
general feeling of relief. I persevered in its use and finally got so I
could move around without limping, when I told my friends that it was
Warner's Safe Rheumatic Cure that had put me on my feet."</p>

<p>"And do you regard your cure as permanent?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, I haven't been so well in years as I am now, and although I
have been subjected to frequent and severe changes of weather this winter,
I have not felt the first intimation of the return of my rheumatic
trouble."</p>

<p>"Do you object to the publication of this interview, Mr. Ashley?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, sir. I look upon it as a duty I owe my fellow creatures to
alleviate their sufferings so far as I am able, and any communication
regarding my symptoms and cure that may be sent to me at 506 Maine avenue
will receive prompt and careful attention."</p>

<p>"Judging from your recital, Mr. Ashley, there must be wonderful
curative properties about this medicine?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, there is, sir, for no man suffered more nor longer than did I
before this remedy gave me relief."</p>

<p>"To go back to the original subject, Mr. Ashley, I suppose you see the
same familiar faces about the lobby session after session?"</p>

<p>"No, not so much so as you might think. New faces are constantly seen
and old ones disappear. The strain upon lobbyists is necessarily very
great, and when you add to this the demoralizing effect of late hours and
intemperate habits and the fact that they are after found out in their
steals, their disappearance can easily be accounted for."</p>

<p>"What proportion of these blood-bills are successful?"</p>

<p>"A very small percentage, sir. Notwithstanding the power and influence
of the lobby, but few of these vicious measures pass. Were they successful
it would be a sad commentary upon our system of government, and would
virtually annihilate one branch of it. The great majority of them are
either reported adversely or smothered in committee by the watchfulness
and loyalty of our congressmen."</p>

<p>At the next American Fat Stock Show in Chicago, there promises to be an
extensive exhibit of dairy products. The Illinois Dairymen's Association
will have it in charge, and the State Board of Agriculture has decided to
appropriate $500 as a premium fund for the Dairymen's Association. It is
rather strange, yet nevertheless true, that Illinois has never yet had an
exhibition of dairy products at all commensurate with the importance of
the dairy interest of the State. It may now be reasonably predicted that
this remark will not remain true after November next. We have heard
nothing said about it, but it is to be presumed there will be no extra
charge to visit this exhibit. The managers of the Fat Stock Show have not
been satisfied, we believe, with experiments in this direction.</p>

<p>Many years ago a young Scotch gardener brought from Mexico to Kenosha,
Wis., a specimen of the Century plant. It was then supposed to be about
twenty years old. For more than forty years this man cared for his pet
with unflagging faithfulness. Dying at the age of sixty-five he left it to
the care of a little daughter of a lady who had shown him kindness. This
girl grew to womanhood and to middle age caring tenderly for the plant.
About two years ago the plant exhibiting signs of blooming, a gentleman
joined with the lady and erected a building for it near the Exposition
building, in this city. Here it has since been, but through carelessness
it was unduly exposed to the terrible freeze of the first week in January
last, and the plant is now past recovery. The lady had expended upon it
about all the means she possessed expecting to reap from admission fees to
see it a rich reward. Thus eighty years of care and constant expense came
to naught in a single night. A neglect to order coal resulted in the fire
going out just when the cold was the most intense. One can hardly imagine
the disappointment and regret of the lady who had nursed it with such care
for nearly a lifetime.</p>

<hr class="c33" />

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Lumber"></a>LUMBER AND SHINGLES.</h2>

<p>The white pine lumber product of the Northwest last year was according
to latest returns, 7,624,789,786 feet against 3,993,780,000 in 1873, and
more than double what it was in 1874. In 1882 the production was nearly
100,000,000 feet less than last year. The smallest product of the decade
was in 1877&mdash;3,595,333,496 feet. What is termed the Chicago District,
including the points of Green Bay, Cheboygan, Manistee, Ludington, White
Lake, Muskegon, Grand Haven, and Spring Lake, and a few scattering mills
gave a product in 1883 of 2,111,070,076 feet. At Ludington and Grand Haven
there has been a decline in the product since 1873; at all the other
points the increase has been considerable, amounting to a total of nearly
800,000,000 feet. The largest cut is on the Mississippi river in what is
known as the West of Chicago District. Here in 1873 the product amounted
to 650,000,000 feet; last year it reached 1,290,062,690 feet. The Saginaw
Valley gives the next greatest yield 961,781,164 feet. The total Saginaw
district gave last year 1,439,852,067 feet against 792,358,000 ten years
ago. The total of the West of Chicago District was 3,134,331,793 against
1,353,000,000 in 1873. The Railroad and Interior Mills District has
increased something over 200,000,000 feet in this period.</p>

<p>In shingles we have the grand product in all the Northwest of
3,964,736,639 against 2,277,433,550 in 1873. The greatest increase was in
the Chicago District as given above, and here Ludington and Grand Haven
come in for an increase at the former place of over 33,000,000, and the
latter of more than 100,000,000. The total production of shingles in 1882
was larger than last year by about 130,000,000, but with that exception
was the largest ever known.</p>

<p>The census of 1880 placed the annual lumber product of the United
States at 18,000,000,000 feet. The Northwest then produced 5,651,295,000
feet or nearly one-third the entire product of the country. If this ratio
has been uniform since we must now have a yield of over 20,000,000,000
feet. These are figures of enormous magnitude and of varied import. They
mean employment to an army of men, a large shipping interest, vast
investments in mills and machinery, and vast incomes to owners of pine
lands; they mean houses and barns and fences to a new and populous empire;
they mean numberless farms and millions of live stock. They also signify a
rapid destruction of our immense forests from the face of the earth,
enormous prices for lumber to future generations, and possible floods to
devastate our river bottoms, and drouths to scourge the highlands. They
should impress us all with the necessity and the profitableness of timber
planting on the unsettled and newly settled prairies and in thousands of
places in all the older States.</p>

<hr class="c33" />

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Foot_Mouth"></a>FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE.</h2>

<p>Alarming reports from different parts of the country announcing the
presence of foot-and-mouth disease have caused no inconsiderable
excitement among the people and in Government circles. First there came
news of an outbreak in Effingham county, Illinois, then in Louisa county,
Iowa, quickly followed by similar information from Adair county,
Missouri.</p>

<p>Dr. Paaren, dispatched to Effingham county by the Governor, reports the
trouble there not foot-and-mouth disease. There does exist a disease
there, however, similar to foot-rot in sheep, that is proving fatal to
many cattle. There have also been outbreaks of disease among cattle near
Duquoin and Xenia, Illinois, which Dr. Paaren has been directed to
investigate.</p>

<p>No official reports as to the disease in Iowa and Missouri have been
received, though Government Veterinary inspectors are now upon the ground
making their investigations. It is said that several hundred head of
cattle are affected in Missouri, though this is probably an
exaggeration.</p>

<p>There is no news regarding the disease in Maine.</p>

<p>Reports from Kansas say the infected herds are strictly quarantined,
and that as yet no fresh outbreaks have occurred. It is proposed to
annihilate the five infected herds.</p>

<p>Gov. Glick has convened the Legislature of Kansas in order that proper
measures may be taken to protect the cattle interests of the State.</p>

<p>A Des Moines dispatch dated the 15th, says letters from Louisa county
to the Governor in regard to the new cattle disease were read in the
House, and on motion of Mr. Watrous that body adopted the substitute for
the bill providing for the appointment of a State veterinary surgeon. The
substitute authorizes the veterinary surgeon to destroy all stock affected
with contagious disease. The bill is intended to enable the State to take
action in the foot-and-mouth disease now affecting the stock. Discussion
then followed upon the substitute, which was taken up section by section,
and it was for the most part adopted.</p>

<p>The series of reported outbreaks mentioned has aroused Congress to the
necessity of action. The Senate on Monday passed a joint resolution
appropriating $50,000 for the suppression of the disease in whatever State
or Territory it appears.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that the Animal Industry bill will at once pass and
become a law. The cattle dealers at the Chicago Union Stock Yards have
organized a Live Stock Exchange, and the first action taken by it is to
fight this bill in Congress. Emory A. Storrs, attorney for the heavy
brokers, is in Washington working might and main for its defeat. He finds
it uphill work, evidently, for on Monday he sent a dispatch to Nelson
Morris in these words: "Send to-day a delegation of strong men; everything
now depends on backing; wire me at once protest; have seen several
senators this morning; advise me when delegation starts; have them stop at
Riggs house."</p>

<p>Acting under this advice the Exchange passed the following resolutions
of "unbelief."</p>

<p class="blockquote">Whereas, It is the universal sentiment of the
Chicago Live Stock Exchange, at the Union Stock Yards in Chicago, that the
bill now pending before Congress, known as the "Animal Industry bill," is
dangerous in its design, not called for by the condition of the live stock
interest in this country, and tends to place too much power in the
Department of Agriculture at Washington; therefore,</p>

<p class="blockquote">Resolved, That Elmer Washburn, Allan Gregory, F. D.
Bartlett, B. F. Harrison, and H. H. Conover, members of this exchange, be,
and hereby are, appointed a committee, with instructions to proceed
forthwith to Washington, and present these resolutions to the proper
authorities to prevent the passage of said "Animal Industry bill."</p>

<p class="blockquote">Resolved, Further, that owing to the present
excitement throughout the United States over the false alarm of
pleuro-pneumonia and "foot-and-mouth" disease, that we, as a body, should
express our views fully upon this question.</p>

<p class="blockquote">1. We do not believe there is such a disease as
contagious pleuro-pneumonia existing throughout the United States.</p>

<p class="blockquote">2. We do not believe that such a disease as the
foot-and-mouth disease exists in either Illinois, Iowa, or Kansas.</p>

<p class="blockquote">3. That at no time within the space of twenty years
have the cattle, sheep, or hogs of this country been in as healthy a
condition as at the present time; for while we are in favor of strict
quarantine laws to prevent any importation of disease into this country
from abroad, we believe if any disease should break out in this State, or
any other State, that the citizens would be interested sufficiently to
stamp it out without expense to the National Government.</p>

<p>While these resolutions were being discussed Dr. Detmers appeared in
the hall (accidentally of course!) and gave it as his opinion that not a
single case of foot-and-mouth disease existed in America to-day. But the
Doctor has so often put his foot in it in his mouthings about animal
diseases in the past that his beliefs or disbeliefs have little weight
with the public. The Doctor is evidently "put out" because he was not
called upon to visit the infected districts, for he is reported as ending
his harangue by declaring he was tired of working for the Government, and
offered his services to the Live Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>Such, in brief, is a summary of the news of the week concerning the
foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks in the States.</p>

<hr class="c33" />

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Premiums"></a>PREMIUMS ON CORN.</h2>

<p>As briefly stated in a previous issue of <span class="smcap">The
Prairie Farmer</span>, the Illinois State Board of Agriculture offers a
premium of $100 for the best bushel of corn (in ear) grown this year in
the northern division of the State, and $50 for the second best bushel:
and a like premium for the best and second best bushel grown in the
central and southern divisions. These divisions correspond with the three
judicial divisions of the State. The following are the conditions:</p>

<p>Each of the parties awarded the first premium to deliver twenty-five
bushels, and each of the parties awarded the second premium to deliver
fifteen bushels of corn in the ear in <span class="pagenum">[Pg
185]</span>sacks to the State Board of Agriculture at Springfield, Ill.
The corn delivered to be equal in quality to the samples awarded the
respective premiums. The premiums to be paid when the premium bushels of
corn and the amounts called for are compared at the rooms of the
Department of Agriculture and favorably reported upon by the
committee.</p>

<p>Affidavit as to measurement of land and yield of corn are required.</p>

<p>We suppose also that competitors are to furnish characteristics of
soil, variety of seed, kinds of manure used, mode of cultivation etc., as
these facts would seem to be necessary if the public is to receive the
full benefits of the experiments the premiums are likely to bring out.</p>

<p>It is understood that the corn delivered to the State Board as per
above conditions is to be in some judicious manner distributed to the
corn-growers of the State for planting in 1885.</p>

<hr class="c33" />

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Unfortunate"></a>THE FIRST UNFORTUNATE
RESULT.</h2>

<p>There recently began in Scotland an earnest movement to induce the
British Government to remove the restrictions regarding the importation of
American cattle, so far at least as to allow the admission of store cattle
for feeding purposes. Meetings have been held in various parts of Scotland
at which petitions like the following were adopted.</p>

<p class="blockquote">To the Right Honorable William Ewart Gladstone.</p>

<p class="blockquote">We, the undersigned, farmers and others,
respectfully submit that the present law which allows the importation of
cattle from the United States, and shuts out store cattle, is unjust and
oppressive to the farmers of this country, and enhances the price of meat
to the public. We therefore crave that her Majesty's Government would open
the Scottish ports to the introduction of store cattle from the Western
States where disease does not exist.</p>

<p>At a meeting at Montrose, where the above petition was favorably acted
upon, Mr. Falconer, an Angus farmer, in supporting the motion, said that
the first great remedy for the present depression was to get cheap store
cattle, and that would never be got until they opened their ports to the
Western States of America. He held that if farmers would agree to insist
on live store cattle being allowed to be landed in Britain, they would
soon get them. When they get them, he, if then alive, would be quite
willing to take all the responsibility if they found an unsound or
unhealthy animal amongst them. He appealed to butchers in Montrose, who
had been in the way of killing States or Canadian cattle, if they were not
totally free of disease; and he would like to ask them how many Irish
cattle they killed which were perfectly healthy. If they got stores from
America, they would not effect a saving in price, but, as they all knew,
sound healthy cattle fed much quicker than unsound, and were of better
quality, and thus an additional item of profit would be secured to the
farmer.</p>

<p>Mr. A. Milne, cattle-dealer, Montrose, corroborated Mr. Falconer's
statements as to the healthiness of American stock, while Irish cattle, as
a rule, he said, had very bad livers.</p>

<p>Mr. Adamson, Morphie, said he had recently been in the Western States
of America, and had seen a number of the ranches in Nebraska, Wyoming, and
Colorado. The cattle there were certainly fine animals&mdash;well bred, as
a rule, either from Herefords or Short-horns, with a dash of the Texan
cattle in them. When there, he made careful inquiries as to the existence
of disease, and he was universally told that such a thing as epidemic
disease was unknown. No doubt in the southern part of Texas there was a
little Texan fever, but that, like yellow fever, was merely indigenous to
the district. It was never seen out of these parts. He considered it would
be a great boon to the farmers of Scotland if they could get cattle £3 or
£4 cheaper than at present. It would save a very considerable amount of
money in stocking a farm, and would also tell on the profits of the
feeders, and the prices paid by the consumers. They had them to spare in
America in the greatest possible abundance.</p>

<p>At a late meeting of the Prairie Cattle Company, having headquarters in
Scotland, sheriff Guthrie Smith expressed the opinion that the great
profit in the future of American ranch companies must be the trade in
young cattle. He believed that Scottish farmers would ere long get all
their young cattle, not from Ireland, but from the United States. It did
not pay them to breed calves; they were better selling milk. The fattening
of cattle for the butcher was the paying part of the business, but the
difficulty was to get yearlings or two-year-olds at their proper
price.</p>

<p>Here promised to arise a new outlet for American stock, and one which
most of us probably never thought of. The proposition had in it the
elements for the building up of a great commercial industry and of
affording a new and rapid impetus to the breeding of cattle upon the
plains. But just at this time comes the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease
in Kansas, Maine, and Illinois, and of course puts an end to all hopes in
this direction, for many months at least. This is the result of the
disease at its first appearance. Here is prospective loss before the
Government veterinary surgeons fairly reach the field of operations
against its spread&mdash;the loss of a trade which would have been worth
many millions to the cattle raisers of the great West. It is to be feared
that this is but the beginning of the losses the disease will entail upon
us. Can Congress longer hesitate in this matter of providing an efficient
law for protection from contagious animal diseases? It would seem not. Our
State authorities, also, must be alert, and render all possible aid in
preventing the spread of this wonderfully infectious disease.</p>

<p>We have a large number of letters and postal cards asking where various
seeds, plants, shrubs, trees, silk-worm eggs, bone dust and so on and so
forth to an indefinite extent, may be obtained. We have answered some of
these inquiries by letter, some through the paper, but they still keep
coming. We have one favor to ask of those seeking this sort of
information: First look through the advertisements carefully, and see if
what is wanted is not advertised. The seedsmen's advertisements do not, of
course, enumerate all the parties have for sale, but it may be taken for
granted that they keep nearly all kinds of grass, grain, and vegetable
seeds. We would also say to seedsmen that it will probably be found to pay
them to advertise the seeds of the new grasses, alfalfa, the special
fertilizers, etc., that are now being so much inquired about. We have a
large number of inquiries about where to obtain silk-worm eggs. Persons
who have them certainly make a mistake in not advertising them freely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. G. B., Sheboygan Falls, Wis</span>.&mdash;Will
you give directions which will be practical for tanning skins or pelts
with the fur or hair on by the use of oak bark?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer</span>.&mdash;We know of no way the thing
can be done unless a part of the methods are used that are employed in the
tanning of goat skins for making Morocco leather. These are: to soak the
skins to soften them; then put them into a lime vat to remove the hair,
and after to take the lime out in a douche consisting of hen and pigeon
dung. This done, the skins are then sewed up<a name= "fnanchor_s" id=
"fnanchor_s"></a><a href= "#footnote_s" class= "fnanchor">[s]</a> so as to
hold the tanning liquid, which consists of a warm and strong decoction of
Spanish sumac. The skins are filled with this liquid, then piled up one
above the other and subsequently refilled, two or three times, or as fast
as the liquid is forced through the skins. If the furs or pelts were first
soaked to soften them, all the fatty, fleshy matter carefully removed,
after sewed up as goat skins are, and then filled and refilled several
times with a strong decoction of white oak bark, warm, but not hot, no
doubt the result would prove satisfactory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. J. F. Schlieman, Hartford,
Wis</span>.&mdash;Are there any works on the cultivation of the blueberry,
and if so could you furnish the same? Do you know of any parties that
cultivate them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer</span>.&mdash;We have never come across
anything satisfactory on the cultivation of the blueberry except in Le Bon
Jardiniere, which says: "The successful cultivation of the whole tribe of
Vacciniums is very difficult. The shrubs do not live long and are
reproduced with much difficulty, either by layers or seeds." The
blueberry, like the cranberry, appears to be a potash plant, the swamp
variety not growing well except where the water is soft, the soil peaty
above and sandy below. The same appears also to be true of the high land
blueberry; the soil where they grow is generally sandy and the water soft.
You can procure Le Bon Jardiniere (a work which is a treasure to the
amateur in fruit and plants) of Jansen, McClurg &amp; Co., of Chicago, at 30
cents, the franc. Some parties, we think, offer blueberry plants for sale,
but we do not recollect who they are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H. Harris, Holt'S Prairie, Ill</span>.&mdash;Will
it do to tile drain land which has a hard pan of red clay twelve to
eighteen inches below the surface?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer</span>.&mdash;It will do no harm to the land
to drain it if there is a hard pan near the surface, but in order to make
tile draining effective on such land, the drains will have to be at half
the distance common on soils without the hard pan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Subscriber, Decatur, Ill</span>.&mdash;In testing
seed corn, what per cent must sprout to be called first-class. I have some
twenty bushels of Stowell's Evergreen that was carefully gathered,
assorted, and shelled by hand. This I have tested by planting
twenty-one grains, of which sixteen grew. How would you class it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer</span>.&mdash;Ninety-five, certainly. If
five kernels out of twenty-one failed to grow, that would be 31 per cent
of bad seed, and we should consider the quality inferior. But further, if
under the favorable condition of trial, 31 percent failed, ten grains in
every twenty-one would be almost sure to, in the field. It was a mistake
to shell the corn; seed should always remain on the cob to the last
moment, because if it is machine or hand-shelled at low temperature, and
put away in bulk, when warm weather comes, it is sure to sweat, and if it
heats, the germ is destroyed. Better spread your corn out in the dry, and
where it will not freeze, as soon as you can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">L. C. Leaniartt (?) Nebraska</span>.&mdash;I wish

necessary to keep them out till the grass gets a good start? 2. Shall I
follow the directions you gave Mr. Perkins in <span class="smcap">The
Prairie Farmer</span>, February 9? 3. Is not blue grass pasture the best
thing I can give my hogs?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer</span>.&mdash;1. Better do so, and you will
then be more likely to get a good catch and full stand. 2. Certainly, if
the conditions are the same. 3. Blue grass is very good for hogs, but it
is improved by the addition of clover.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. C. Samuels, Springfield, Ill</span>.&mdash;1.
What pears would you recommend for this latitude? 2. Are there any which
do not blight? 3. I have some grape vines, light colored fruit, but late,
Elvira, I think the nurseryman told me, which appear to be suffering from
something at the roots. What is the phylloxera, and what shall I do to my
grape vines if they infest the roots?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer</span>.&mdash;The Bartlett for
<i>certain</i>&mdash;it being the best of all the pears&mdash;and the
Kieffer and Le Conte for <i>experiment</i>. If the latter succeed you will
have lots of nice large fruit just about as desirable for eating as a Ben
Davis apple in May. 2. We know of one only, the Tyson, a smallish summer
pear that never blights, at least in some localities, where all others do
more or less. 3. If your Elviras are afflicted with the phylloxera, a
root-bark louse, manure and fertilize them at once, and irrigate or water
them in the warm season. The French vine-growers seem at last to have
found out that lice afflict half starved grape roots, as they do half
starved cattle, and that they have only to feed and water carefully to
restore their vines to health.</p>

<p class="center">BY A MAN OF THE PRAIRIE.</p>

<p>A neighbor of mine who has been intending to purchase store cattle and
sheep at the Chicago Stock Yards soon, asked me last night what I thought
about his doing so. I asked him if he had read what <span
class="smcap">The Prairie Farmer</span> and other papers had contained of
late regarding foot-and-mouth disease in Maine, Kansas, Illinois, and
Iowa. He had not; did not take the papers, and had not heard anything
about the disease here or in England. Then I explained to him, as best I
could, its nature, contagious character, etc., and having a <span
class="smcap">Prairie Farmer</span> in my pocket, read him your brief
history of the ailment in Great Britain. Well, that man was astonished.
Finally, said he, What has that got to do with my question about buying
cattle and sheep at the stock yards? Just this, I replied: every day there
are arrivals at the stock yards of many thousands of cattle from these
infected States. Perhaps some of them come from the very counties where
this disease is known to exist. The disease may break out any day in
scores of places in all these States. It may appear&mdash;indeed is quite
likely to do so at the stock yards. For aught I know it may be there now.
The cattle brokers will not be very likely to make known such an unwelcome
fact a minute sooner than they are obliged to. In fact, from what they
have lately been saying about the absurdity of new and stringent
enactments concerning animal diseases, I conclude they will labor to
conceal cases that may really exist. Now you go there to pick up cattle to
consume your pasturage this spring and summer, and don't you see you run
the risk of taking to your home and neighborhood a disease that may cost
you and your neighbors many thousands of dollars? If I were you I would
pick up the stock I want in my own neighborhood and county, even though
not exactly the kind I would like to have, and though it would cost me a
great deal more time and trouble. You see to a Man of the Prairie things
look a little squally in this cattle business. We have all got to be
careful about this thing. We have a terrible enemy at our stable doors and
pasture gates, and we must guard them well. I am not an alarmist, but I
would run any time, almost, rather than get licked, and I have always
tried to keep a lock on the stable door before the horse is stolen. I am
in favor of <i>in</i>-trenchment. Perhaps my advice to my neighbor was not
sound, but according to the light I have, I have no desire to recall it
till I hear more from the infected districts.</p>

<hr class="c10" />

<p>To show the difference between the winter in Colorado and the States
this way and further west, the Farmer, of Denver, mentions the fact that
it knows a farmer who has had about two hundred acres of new land broken
between the middle of November and the first of March. Still, these
Eastern States have advantages which render them rather pleasant to live
in. Our farmers find plenty of time in fall and spring in which to do
their plowing and sowing, and our severe winters don't seem to hurt the
ground a bit. In fact, I suppose it has got used to them, sort of
acclimated, as it were. We have pretty good markets, low railway fares,
good schools and plenty of them, and we manage to enjoy ourselves just as
well as though we could hitch up to the plow and do our breaking in
December and January. We can't all go to Colorado, Dakota, Montana, or
Washington Territory, nor to those other Edens at the South and Southwest
where a man, so far as winter is concerned, may work about every day in
the year; but don't do so any more than we here at the North where we have
the excuse of severe weather for our laziness between November and April.
I like Colorado and Wyoming, Arkansas and Texas, Alabama and
Florida&mdash;for other people who like to make their homes there, but my
home is here and I like it. "I don't <i>have</i> to" plow in winter, and I
don't need to. I am going to try to do my duty and be happy where I am,
believing Heaven to be just as near Illinois as any other State or any
Territory.</p>

<p>I read in the dispatches this morning that the barns on a ranch near
Omaha burned the other night. With the barns were consumed twenty-six
cows, eighteen horses, 1,000 bushels of corn and a large lot of hay and
oats. In all the loss amounted to above $10,000 and there was no
insurance. From all over the country and at all times of the year I read
almost daily of similar losses varying from $100 up into the thousands,
and the closing sentence of about nine out of ten of these announcements
is "no insurance." Now I am neither an insurance agent nor a lightning rod
peddler, but there are two luxuries that I indulge in all the time, and
these are an insurance policy to fairly cover my farm buildings and their
contents, and what I believe to be well constructed lightning rods in
sufficient number to protect the property from electric eccentricities.
True, my buildings have never suffered from fire or lightning and these
luxuries have cost me no inconsiderable amount of cash, but this money has
brought me relief from a heap of anxiety, for I know in case my property
is swept away I am not left stripped and powerless to provide for my
family, and I know that it will not be necessary to mortgage the farm to
furnish them a shelter. I don't take <i>cheap</i> insurance either, but
invest my money in the policy of a company which I believe has abundant
capital and is cautiously managed. A wealthy man can take his fire risks
in his own hands if he chooses, but for a man of small or moderate means
it seems to me the height of folly to do so. I would rather go without
tobacco or "biled shirts" than insurance and lightning rods.</p>

<p>I don't know that an American farmer ever had the gout. Certainly I
never heard of such a case. If one does get the ailment, however, if he

instantaneous. Why don't Bismarck try this home remedy for his
complication of gout and trichinæ?</p>

<h2 class="no-break">Chicken Chat.</h2>

<p>One of my correspondents writes: "My hens don't eat well&mdash;they
just pick over the food as if it were not good enough for them&mdash;and
they don't lay well; in fact they don't do much of anything except to mope
about&mdash;not as if sick, but as if lazy."</p>

<p>Probably you have fed the same thing every day for the last six months,
and the hens are getting tired of it. Hens are like other
people&mdash;they like a change of provender once in
awhile&mdash;especially when confined indoors. Sometimes over-feeding will
cause indigestion, and then the biddies will exhibit the symptoms you
describe. In either case, let the fowls fast for a whole day, and then for
a few days feed lightly with food that is different from what they have
been living on. Give plenty of green food, also Douglas' mixture in the
drinking water twice a week.</p>

<hr class="c10" />

<p>Another correspondent wants to know why I always advise giving cooked
food to fowls and chicks when uncooked food is the natural diet.</p>

<p>I advise cooked food because experience has taught me that it is much
better for poultry than the raw articles would be. Because raw bugs and
worms constitute the "natural diet" of fowls in their wild state, it does
not follow that raw meal and potatoes would be the best and most
economical food for our domestic fowls. Other things being equal, chicks
that are fed on cooked food grow fatter, are less liable to disease, and
thrive better generally than those who worry along on uncooked
rations.</p>

<hr class="c10" />

<p>If you are short of sitting hens and don't own an incubator, make the
hens do double duty. Set two or more at the same time, and when the chicks
come out, give two families to one hen, and set the other over again. To
do this successfully, the chicks must be taken from the nest as soon as
dry and given to the hen that is to raise them; for if a hen once leaves
the nest with her chicks, no amount of moral suasion will induce her to go
back. Before giving the hen fresh eggs, the nest should be renovated and
the hen dusted with sulphur or something to prevent lice.</p>

<hr class="c10" />

<p>A lady who commenced raising thoroughbred poultry last season writes me
that she proposes to sell eggs for hatching this season, and asks for
information about advertising, packing eggs, etc.</p>

<p>The advertising is easy enough: all you have to do is to write a copy
of your "ad.," send it to <span class="smcap">The Prairie Farmer</span>
and other papers that circulate among farmers, pay the bills, and answer
the postals and letters as they come. But if I were in your shoes, I would
"put my foot down" on the postals to begin with; they don't amount to
anything anyway; the people who ask a long string of questions on a postal
card are not, as a rule, the ones who become customers. Before we went
into the poultry business an old poultry-breeder said: "Don't have
anything to do with postals, it don't pay." We thought differently, but to
satisfy ourselves, we kept track of the postals, and to-day I have the
addresses of over 300 people who wrote us on postal cards. How many of
those people became customers? Just one, and he was an Ohio man. When I go
into that branch of the poultry business again, my advertisements will
contain a postscript<a name= "fnanchor_t" id= "fnanchor_t"></a><a href=
"#footnote_t" class= "fnanchor">[t]</a> which will read thusly: "No
postals answered."</p>

<p>And you need not expect that every letter will mean business; people
who have not the remotest idea of buying eggs will write and ask your
prices, etc., and you must answer them all alike. Here is where circulars
save lots of work and postage. I have sent you by mail what I call a model
circular, and from that you can get up something to fit your case. Pack
your eggs in baskets in cut straw or chaff, first wrapping each egg
separately in paper. The eggs should not touch each other or the basket.
Put plenty of packing on top, and with a darning needle and stout twine
sew on a cover of stout cotton cloth. For the address use shipping tags,
or else mark it plainly on the white cotton cover; I prefer the latter
way. A day or two before you ship the eggs send a postal telling your
customer when to look for them; that's all that postals are good for.</p>

<p>Concerning the duplicating of orders in cases of failure of the eggs to
hatch, I quote from one of my old circulars: "I guarantee to furnish fresh
eggs, true to name, from pure-bred, standard fowls, packed to carry safely
any distance. In cases of total failure, when the eggs have been properly
cared for and set within two weeks after arrival, orders will be
duplicated free of charge." I furnished just what I promised, and when a
total failure was reported I sent the second sitting free&mdash;though
sometimes I felt sure that the eggs were not properly cared for, and once
a man reported a failure when, as I afterwards learned, eight eggs of the
first sitting hatched. But, generally speaking, my customers were pretty
well satisfied. It sometimes happens that only one or two eggs out of a
sitting will hatch, and naturally the customer feels that he has not
received the worth of his money. In such cases, if both parties are
willing to do just what is right, the matter can be arranged so that all
will be satisfied. And you will sometimes get hold of a customer that
nothing under the heavens will satisfy; when this happens, do just exactly
as you would wish to be done by, and there let the matter end.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Bees"></a>Spring Care of Bees.</h2>

<p>Although yesterday was very cold and inclement, to-day (March 11th) is
warm and pleasant, and bees that are wintered upon their summer stands
will be upon the wing. It would be well on such days as this to see that
all entrances to hives are open, so that no hindrances may be in the way
of house-cleaning. This is all we think necessary for this month, provided
they have plenty of stores to last until flowers bloom. Handling bees
tends to excite them to brood rearing, and veterans in bee-culture claim
that this uses up the vitality of bees in spring very fast. Although more
young may be reared, it is at the risk of the old ones, as they leave the
hive in search of water; many thus perish, which often results in the
death of the colony, as the young perish for want of nurses. Sometimes,
also, in handling bees early in the season the queens are lost, as they
may fall upon the ground, yet chilled, and perish.</p>

<p>Bees consume food very fast while rearing brood; naturalists tells us
that insects during the larvæ state consume more food than they do during
the remainder of their existence. Where a bee-keeper has been so
improvident as to neglect to provide abundance of stores for his bees he
should examine them carefully, and if found wanting, remove an empty
frame, substituting a full one in its place. Where frames of honey are not
to be had, liquid honey and sugar can be kneaded together, forming cakes,
which can be placed over the cluster. Care should be taken that no
apertures are left, thus forming a way for cold drafts through the hive.
These cakes are thought to excite bees less than when liquid food is
given; they have another advantage, also, viz., bees can cluster upon them
while<a name= "fnanchor_u" id= "fnanchor_u"></a><a href= "#footnote_u"
class= "fnanchor">[u]</a> feeding, and do not get chilled.</p>

<p>Bees that have been wintered in cellars, or special repositories, are
often injured by being removed too early to their summer stands. It would
be better to let them remain, and lower the temperature during warm days
with ice, until warm weather has come to stay. An aged veteran in Vermont
that we visited the season following the disastrous winter of 1880-81,
told us that his neighbors removed their bees from the cellar during a
warm spell early in spring, and they were then in splendid condition. He
let his bees remain until pollen was plentiful, and brought them out, all
being in fine order; by this time his neighbors' colonies were all
dead.</p>

<p>Good judgment and care must be exercised in removing bees from the
cellar, or disastrous results will follow. We know of an apiary of over
one hundred colonies that was badly injured, indeed nearly ruined, by all
being taken from the cellar at once on a fine, warm day. The bees all
poured out of the hives for a play spell, like children from school, and
having been confined so long together in one apartment had acquired, in
some measure, the same scent, and soon things were badly mixed. Some
colonies swarmed, others caught the fever, and piled up together in a huge
mass. This merry making may have been fun for the bees, but it was the
reverse of this for the owner, as many queens were destroyed, and hives
that were populous before were carried from the cellar and left without a
bee to care for the unhatched brood.</p>

<p>When it is time to remove bees from the cellar the stands they are to
occupy should be prepared beforehand. They should be higher at the back,
inclining to the front; if the height of two bricks are at the back, one
will answer for the front. This inclination to the front is an important
matter; it facilitates the carrying out of dead bees and debris from the
hive, the escape of moisture, and last, and most important item, bees will
build their comb straight in the frame instead of crosswise of the hive,
and their surplus comb in boxes correspondingly. If a few hives are
removed near the close of the day and put in different parts of the
apiary, the danger from swarming out is avoided, for the bees will become
quiet before morning, and being far apart will not mix up when they have
their play spell. The success of bee-keeping depends upon the faithful
performance of infinite little items.</p>

<p>The many friends of the Rev. L. L. Langstroth will be pained to learn
that he has a severe attack of his old malady and unable to do any mental
work. May the Lord deal kindly and gently with him.</p>

<p>During the last fall and winter he has been the light of many
conventions, and it will be remembered as a pleasant episode in the lives
of many bee-keepers that they had the privilege of viewing his beaming
countenance, hearing the words of wisdom as they escaped from his lips,
and taking the hand of this truly great and good man.</p>

have lately come to my desk, a reminder of my boyhood days, when, in the
old home with my father, I used to contribute an article now and then to
its columns. There is an old scrap-book on the shelf, at my right, now,
with some of those articles in it, published nearly thirty years ago. But
my object in writing now is to add something to Mrs. Harrison's article on
Extracted Honey. Last year my honey crop was about 3,000 pounds, and half
of this was extracted, or slung honey, as we bee-keepers often call it;
but for next year I have decided to raise nearly all comb honey, for the
reason that I do not get customers so readily for extracted honey. I have
never extracted until the honey was all, or nearly all, capped over, and
then admitted air into the vessels holding it, so as to be absolutely sure
of getting it "dry," and proof against souring. This method has given me
about half the amount others obtained by extracting as soon as the combs
were filled by the bees, and ripening afterward.</p>

<p>But in spite of all these precautions I find so much prejudice against
extracted honey, growing out of the ignorance of the public with regard to
this sweet, ignorance equaled only by the ignorance in regard to bees
themselves, that the sale of such honey has been very slow; so slow that
while my comb honey is reduced at this date to about 150 pounds, I have
several ten-gallon kegs of pure white honey still on hand.</p>

<p>Especially is there a prejudice against candied honey, though that is
an absolute test of purity, and it can be readily liquified, as Mrs. H.
says, without injury. When I say that it is an absolute test of purity I
mean that all honey that candies evenly is pure, though some of the best
honey I have ever had never candied at all. In one case I knew the honey
to candy in the combs of a new swarm early in autumn; but some seasons,
particularly very dry ones, it will hardly candy at all. This difference
seems to be due to the varying proportion of natural glucose, which will
crystallize, and levulose, or mellose, which will not crystallize.
Manufactured glucose will not crystallize; and some of our largest honey
merchants, even the Thurbers, of New York, have mixed artificial glucose
with honey to avoid loss by the ignorant prejudice of the public.</p>

<p>The most promising field for men of talent and ambition at the present
day is the railroad service. The pay is large in many instances, while the
service is continuous and honorable. Most of our railroad men began life
on the farm. Of this class is the author of the accompanying books
descriptive of railway operations, who has been connected continuously
with railroads as a subordinate and officer for 27 years. He was brought
up on a farm, and began railroading as a lad at $7 per month. He has
written a number of standard books on various topics connected with the
organization, construction, management and policy of railroads. These
books are of interest not only to railroad men but to the general reader
as well. They are indispensable to the student. They present every phase
of railroad life, and are written in an easy and simple style that both
interests and instructs. The books are as follows:</p>

 title="Silk Culture" /></p>

<h2 class="no-break">Osage for Silk-Worms.</h2>

<p>In a private letter to the editor of <span class="smcap">The Prairie
Farmer</span> Dr. L. S. Pennington, of Whiteside County, Illinois, says:
"Many thanks for your instructive articles on Silk Culture. Could the many
miles of Osage orange found in this State be utilized for this purpose,
the industry would give employment to thousands of dependent women and
children, by which means they could make themselves, at least in part,
self-supporting. I hope that you will continue to publish and instruct
your many readers on this subject."</p>

<p>Anent this subject we find the following by Prof. C. V. Riley in a late
issue of the American Naturalist:</p>

<p>"There is a strong disposition on the part of those who look for making
money by the propagation and sale of mulberry trees, to underrate the use
of Osage orange as silk-worm food. We have thoroughly demonstrated, by the
most careful tests, on several occasions, that when Maclura aurantiaca is
properly used for this purpose, the resulting silk loses nothing in
quantity or quality, and we have now a strain of Sericaria mori that has
been fed upon the plant for twelve consecutive years without
deterioration. There has been, perhaps, a slight loss of color which, if
anything, must be looked upon as an advantage. It is more than likely, how
ever, that the different races will differ in their adaptability to the
Maclura, and that for the first year the sudden transition to Maclura from
Morus, upon which the worms have been fed for centuries, may result in
some depreciation. Mr. Virion des Lauriers, at the silk farm at Genito,
has completed some experiments on the relative value of the two plants,
which he details in the opening number of the Silk-Grower's Guide and
Manufacturer's Gazette. Four varieties of worms were reared. The race
known as the "Var" was fed throughout on mulberry leaves. The "Pyrenean"
and "Cevennes" worms were fed throughout on leaves and branches of Osage
orange, while the "Milanese" worms were fed on Maclura up to the second
molt and then changed to mulberry leaves. At the close examples of each
variety of cocoons were sent to the Secretary of the Silk Board at Lyons,
and appraised by him The Maclura-fed cocoons were rated at 85 cents per
pound, those raised partly on Osage and partly on mulberry at 95 cents per
pound, and those fed entirely on mulberry at $1.11 per pound.</p>

<p>"This, Mr. des Lauriers thinks, seems to show that the difference
between Maclura and Morus as silk-worm food is some 'twenty-five to thirty
per cent in favor of the latter, while it is evident that the leaf of the
Osage orange can be used with some advantage during the first two ages of
the worms, thus allowing the mulberry tree to grow more leafy for feeding
during the last three ages.' The experiment, although interesting, is not
conclusive, from the simple fact that different races were used in the
different tests and not the same races, so that the result may have been
due, to a certain extent, to race and not to food."</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Scientific"></a>SCIENTIFIC AND USEFUL.</h2>

<p>A writer in an English medical journal declares that the raising of the
head of the bed, by placing under each leg a block of the thickness of two
bricks, is an effective remedy for cramps. Patients who have suffered at
night, crying aloud with pain, have found this plan to afford immediate,
certain, and permanent relief.</p>

<p>California stands fifth in the list of States in the manufacture of
salt, and is the only State in the Union where the distillation of salt
from sea water is carried on to any considerable extent. This industry has
increased rapidly during the last twenty years. The production has risen
from 44,000 bushels in 1860 to upwards of 880,000 bushels in 1883.</p>

<hr class="c10" />

<p>The amount of attention given to purely technical education in Saxony
is shown by the fact that there are now in that kingdom the following
schools: A technical high school in Dresden, a technical State institute
at Chemnitz, and art schools in Dresden and Leipzig, also four builders'
schools, two for the manufacture of toys, six for shipbuilders, three for
basket weavers, and fourteen for lace making. Besides these there are the
following trade schools supported by different trades, foundations,
endowments, and districts: Two for decorative painting, one for
watchmakers, one for sheet metal workers, three for musical instrument
makers, one for druggists (not pharmacy), twenty-seven for weaving, one
for machine embroidery, two for tailors, one for barbers and hairdressers,
three for hand spinning, six for straw weaving, three for wood carving,
four for steam boiler heating, six for female handiwork. There are,
moreover, seventeen technical advanced schools, two for gardeners, eight
agricultural, and twenty-six commercial schools.</p>

<hr class="c10" />

<p>The Patrie reports, with apparent faith, an invention of Dr. Raydt, of
Hanover, who claims to have developed fully the utility of carbonic acid
as a motive agent. Under the pressure of forty atmospheres this acid is
reduced to a liquid state, and when the pressure is removed it evaporates
and expands into a bulk 500 times as great as that it occupied before. It
is by means of this double process that the Hanoverian chemist proposes to
obtain such important benefits from the agent he employs. A quantity of
the fluid is liquified, and then stowed away in strong metal receptacles,
securely fastened and provided with a duct and valve. By opening the valve
free passage is given to the gas, which escapes with great force, and may
be used instead of steam for working in a piston. One of the principal
uses to which it has been put is to act as a temporary motive power for
fire engines. Iron cases of liquified carbonic acid are fitted on to the
boiler of the machine, and are always ready for use, so that while steam
is being got up, and the engines can not yet be regularly worked in the
usual way, the piston valves can be supplied with acid gas. There is,
however, another remarkable object to which the new agent can be directed,
and to which it has been recently applied in some experiments conducted at
Kiel. This is the floating of sunken vessels by means of artificial
bladders. It has been found that a bladder or balloon of twenty feet
diameter, filled with air, will raise a mass of over 100 tons. Hitherto
these floats have been distended by pumping air into them through pipes
from above by a cumbrous and tedious process, but Dr. Raydt merely affixes
a sufficient number of his iron gas-accumulators to the necks of the
floats to be used, and then by releasing the gas fills them at once with
the contents.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Cellar"></a>How He Ventilated the
Cellar.</h2>

<p>The effect of foul air upon milk, cream, and butter was often alluded
to at the Dairymen's meeting at DeKalb. A great bane to the dairyman is
carbonic acid gas. In ill ventilated cellars it not only has a pernicious
effect upon milk and its products, but it often renders the living
apartments unhealthful, and brings disease and death to the family. In the
course of the discussion Mr. W. D. Hoard, President of the Northwestern
Dairymen's Association, related the following incident showing how easily
cellars may be ventilated and rendered fit receptacles for articles of
food:</p>

<p>"In the city of Fort Atkinson, where I do reside, Mr. Clapp, the
president of the bank told me that for twenty years he had been unable to
keep any milk or butter or common food of the family in the cellar. I went
and looked at it, and saw gathered on the sleepers above large beads of
moisture, and then knew what was the matter. The cellar was full of foul
air. I said to him, 'Prof. Wilkins is here and will tell you in a few
moments how to remedy this difficulty, and make your cellar a clean and
wholesome apartment of your house.' I went down and got the professor, and
he went up and looked at the cellar, and he says, 'for ten dollars I will
put you in possession of a cellar that will be clean and wholesome.' He
went to work and took a four-inch pipe, made of galvanized iron, soldered
tightly at the joints, passing it down the side of the cellar wall until
it came within two inches of the bottom of the cellar, turned a square
elbow at the top of the wall, carried it under the house, under the
kitchen, up through the kitchen floor and into the kitchen chimney, about
four feet above where the kitchen stovepipe entered. You know the kitchen
stove in all families is in operation about three times a day. The heat
from this kitchen stove acting on the column of air in that little pipe
caused a vacuum, and nature abhors a vacuum, and the result was that in
twenty-four hours that little pipe had drawn the entire foul air out of
the cellar, and he has now a perfect cellar. I drop this hint to show you
that it is within easy reach of every one, for the sum of only about ten
dollars, to have a perfectly ventilated cellar. This carbonic acid gas is
very heavy. It collects in the cellar and you can not get it out unless
you dip it out like water, or pump it out; and it becomes necessary to
apply something to it that shall operate in this way."</p>

<p>This is a matter of such importance, and yet so little thought about,
that we had designed having an illustration made to accompany this
article, but conclude the arrangement<a name= "fnanchor_x" id=
"fnanchor_x"></a><a href= "#footnote_x" class= "fnanchor">[x]</a> is so
simple that any one can go to work and adapt it to the peculiar
construction of his own house, and we hope thousands will make use of Mr.
Hoard's suggestion.</p>

<hr class="c33" />

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Wedding"></a>An Old Roman Wedding.</h2>

<p>As far as the nuptial ceremony itself was concerned, the Romans were in
the habit of celebrating it with many imposing rites and customs, some of
which are still in use in this country. As soon, therefore, as the
sooth-sayer had taken the necessary omens, the ceremony was commenced by a
sheep being sacrificed to Juno, under whose special guardianship marriage
was supposed to rest. The fleece was next laid upon two chairs, on which
the bride and bridegroom sat, over whom prayers were then said. At the
conclusion of the service the bride was led by three young men to the home
of her husband. She generally took with her a distaff and spindle filled
with wool, indicative of the first work in her new married
life&mdash;spinning fresh garments for her husband. Five torches were
carried to light her.</p>

<p>The threshold of the house was gaily decorated with flowers and
garlands; and in order to keep out infection it was anointed with certain
unctuous perfumes<a name= "fnanchor_y" id= "fnanchor_y"></a><a href=
"#footnote_y" class= "fnanchor">[y]</a>. As a preservative, moreover,
against sorcery and evil influences, it was disenchanted by various
charms. After being thus prepared, the bride was lifted over the
threshold, it being considered unlucky for her to tread across it on first
entering her husband's house. The musicians then struck up their music,
and the company sang their "Epithalamium." The keys of the house were then
placed in the young wife's hands, symbolic of her now being mistress. A
cake, too, baked by the vestal virgins, which had been carried before her
in the procession from the place of the marriage ceremony to the husband's
home, was now divided among the guests. To enhance the merriment of the
festive occasion, the bridegroom threw nuts among the boys, who then, as
nowadays enjoyed heartily a grand scramble.</p>

<hr class="c33" />

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Stovepipe"></a>Mr. Smith's Stovepipe.</h2>

<p>Once upon a time there lived a certain man and wife, and their
name&mdash;well, I think it must have been Smith, Mr. and Mrs. John Smith.
One chilly day in October Mrs. Smith said to her husband: "John, I really
think we must have the stove up in the sitting-room." And Mr. Smith from
behind his newspaper answered "Well." Three hundred and forty-six times
did Mr. and Mrs. Smith repeat this conversation, and the three hundred and
forty-seventh time Mr. Smith added: "I'll get Brown to help me about it
some day."</p>

<p>It is uncertain how long the matter would have rested thus, had not
Mrs. Smith crossed the street and asked neighbor Brown to come over and
help her husband set up a stove, and as she was not his wife he politely
consented and came at once.</p>

<p>With a great deal of grunting, puffing, and banging, accompanied by
some words not usually mentioned in polite society, the two men at last
got the stove down from the attic. Mrs. Smith had placed the zinc in its
proper position, and they put the stove way to one side of it, but of
course that didn't matter.</p>

<p>Then they proceeded to put up the stovepipe. Mr. Smith pushed the knee
into the chimney, and Mr. Brown fitted the upright part to the stove. The
next thing was to get the two pieces to come together. They pushed and
pulled, they yanked and wrenched, they rubbed off the blacking onto their
hands, they uttered remarks, wise and otherwise.</p>

<p>Presently it occurred to Mr. Smith that a hammer was just the thing
that was needed, and he went for one. Mr. Brown improved the opportunity
to wipe the perspiration from his noble brow, totally oblivious of the
fact that he thereby ornamented his severe countenance with several
landscapes done in stove blacking. The hammer didn't seem to be just the
thing that was needed, after all. Mr. Smith pounded until he had spoiled
the shape of the stovepipe, and still the pesky thing wouldn't go in, so
he became exasperated and threw away the hammer. It fell on Mr. Brown's
toe, and that worthy man ejaculated&mdash;well, it's no matter what he
ejaculated. Mr. Smith replied to his ejaculation, and then Mr. Brown went
home.</p>

<p>Why continue the tale? Everybody knows that Mr. Smith, after making a
great deal of commotion, finally succeeded in getting the pipe into place,
that he was perfectly savage to everybody for the rest of the day, and
that the next time he and Brown met on the street both were looking
intently the other way.</p>

<p>But there is more to tell. It came to pass in the course of the winter
that the pipe needed cleaning out. Mrs. Smith dreaded the ordeal, both for
her own sake and her husband's. It happened that the kitchen was presided
over by that rarest of treasures, a good-natured, competent hired girl.
This divinity proposed that they dispense with Mr. Smith's help in
cleaning out the pipe, and Mrs. Smith, with a sigh of relief, consented.
They carefully pulled the pipe apart, and, holding the pieces in a
horizontal position that no soot might fall on the carpet, carried it into
the yard.</p>

<p>After they had swept out the pipe and carried it back they attempted to
put it up. That must have been an unusually obstinate pipe, for it
steadily refused to go together. The minds of Mrs. Smith and her housemaid
were sufficiently broad to grasp this fact after a few trials; therefore
they did not waste their strength in vain attempts, but rested, and in an
exceedingly un-masculine way held a consultation. The girl went for a
hammer, and brought also a bit of board. She placed this on the top of the
pipe, raised her hammer, Mrs. Smith held the pipe in place below, two
slight raps, and, lo, it was done.</p>

<p>See what a woman can do. This story is true, with the exception of the
names and a few other unimportant items. I say, and will maintain it, that
as a general thing a woman has more brains and patience and less stupidity
than a man. I challenge any one to prove the contrary.&mdash;<i>N. E.

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Progress"></a>Progress.</h2>

<p>In the course of a lecture on the resources of New Brunswick, Professor
Brown, of the Ontario Agricultural College, told the following story by an
Arabian writer:</p>

<p>"I passed one day by a very rude and beautifully situated hamlet in a
vast forest, and asked a savage whom I saw how long it had been there. 'It
is indeed an old place,' replied he. 'We know it has stood there for 100
years as the hunting home of the great St. John, but how long previous to
that we do not know.'</p>

<p>"One century afterward, as I passed by the same place, I found a busy
little city reaching down to the sea, where ships were loading timber for
distant lands. On asking one of the inhabitants how long this had
flourished, he replied: 'I am looking to the future years, and not to what
has gone past, and have no time to answer such questions.'</p>

<p>"On my return there 100 years afterward, I found a very smoky and
wonderfully-populous city, with many tall chimneys, and asked one of the
inhabitants how long it had been founded. 'It is indeed a mighty city,'
replied he. 'We know not how long it has existed, and our ancestors there
on this subject are as ignorant as ourselves.'</p>

<p>"Another century after that as I passed by the same place, I found a
much greater city than before, but could not see the tall chimneys, and
the air was pure as crystal; the country to the north and the east and the
west, was covered with noble mansions and great farms, full of many cattle
and sheep. I demanded of a peasant, who was reaping grain on the sands of
the sea-shore, how long ago this change took place? 'In sooth, a strange
question!' replied he. 'This ground and city have never been different
from what you now behold them.' 'Were there not of old,' said I, 'many
great manufacturers in this city?' 'Never,' answered he, 'so far as we
have seen, and never did our fathers speak to us of any such.'</p>

<p>"On my return there, 100 years afterward, I found the city was built
across the sea east-ward into the opposite country; there were no horses,
and no smoke of any kind came from the dwellings.</p>

<p>"The inhabitants were traveling through the air on wires which
stretched far into the country on every side, and the whole land was
covered with many mighty trees and great vineyards, so that the noble
mansions could not be seen for the magnitude of the fruit thereof.</p>

<p>"Lastly, on coming back again, after an equal lapse of time, I could
not perceive the slightest vestige of the city. I inquired of a very old
and saintly man, who appeared to be under deep emotion, and who stood
alone upon the spot, how long it had been destroyed. 'Is this a question,'
said he, 'from a man like you? Know ye not that cities are not now part of
the human economy? Every one travels through the air on wings of
electricity, and lives in separate dwellings scattered all over the land;
the ships of the sea are driven by the same power, and go above or below
as found to be best for them. In the cultivation of the soil,' said he,
'neither horse nor steam-power are employed; the plow is not known, nor
are fertilizers of any more value in growing the crops of the field.
Electricity is carried under the surface of every farm and all over-head
like a net; when the inhabitants require rain for any particular purpose,
it is drawn down from the heavens by similar means. The influence of
electricity has destroyed all evil things, and removed all diseases from
among men and beasts, and every living thing upon the earth. All things
have changed, and what was once the noble city of my name is to become the
great meeting place of all the leaders of science throughout the whole
world.'"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Gunkettle, as she spanked the baby in her calm,

<p>"There's one," said Mr. G., throwing a pamphlet on the table.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; a horrid old report of the fruit interests of Michigan; lots
of news in that!" and she sat down on the baby with renewed vigor.</p>

<p>"I'm sure it's plum full of currant news of the latest dates," said the
miserable man. Mrs. Gunkettle retorted that she wouldn't give a fig for a
whole library of such reading, when 'apple-ly the baby shrieked loud
enough to drown all other sounds, and peace was at once restored.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Yarn"></a>Uncle Jim's Yarn.</h2>

<p>Old "Uncle Jim," of Stonington, Conn., ought to have a whole drawer to
himself, for nothing short of it could express the easy-going enlargement
of his mind in narratives. Uncle Jim was a retired sea captain, sealer,
and whaler, universally beloved and respected for his lovely disposition
and genuine good-heartedness, not less than for the moderation of his
statements and the truthful candor of his narrations. It happened that one
of the Yale Professors, who devoted himself to ethnological studies, was
interested in the Patagonians, and very much desired information as to the
alleged gigantic stature of the race. A scientific friend, who knew the
Stonington romancer, told the Professor that he could no doubt get
valuable information from Uncle Jim, a Captain who was familiar with all
the region about Cape Horn. And the Professor, without any hint about
Uncle Jim's real ability, eagerly accompanied his friend to make the
visit. Uncle Jim was found in one of his usual haunts, and something like
the following ethnological conversation ensued:</p>

<p>Professor&mdash;They tell me, Capt. Pennington, that you have been a
good deal in Patagonia.</p>

<p>Uncle Jim&mdash;Made thirty or forty voyages there, sir.</p>

<p>Professor&mdash;And I suppose you know something about the Patagonians
and their habits?</p>

<p>Uncle Jim&mdash;Know all about 'em, sir. Know the Patagonians, sir,
all, all of 'em, as well as I know the Stonington folks.</p>

<p>Professor&mdash;I wanted to ask you, Captain, about the size of the
Patagonians&mdash;whether they are giants, as travelers have reported?</p>

<p>Uncle Jim&mdash;No, sir&mdash;shaking his head slowly, and speaking
with the modest tone of indifference&mdash;no, sir, they are not. (It was
quite probable that the Captain never had heard the suggestion before).
The height of the Patagonian, sir, is just five feet nine inches and a
half.</p>

<p>Professor&mdash;How did you ascertain this fact, Captain?</p>

<p>Uncle Jim&mdash;Measured 'em, sir&mdash;measured 'em. One day when the
mate and I were ashore down there, I called up a lot of the Patagonians,
and the mate and I measured about 500 of them, and every one of them
measured five feet nine inches and a half&mdash;that's their exact
height.</p>

<p>Professor&mdash;That's very interesting. But, Captain, don't you
suppose there were giants there long ago, in the former generations? All
the travelers say so.</p>

<p>Uncle Jim&mdash;Not a word of truth in it, sir&mdash;not a word. I'd
heard that story and I thought I'd settle it. I satisfied myself there was
nothing in it.</p>

<p>Professor&mdash;But how could you know that they used not to be giants?
What evidence could you get? Mightn't the former race have been
giants?</p>

<p>Uncle Jim&mdash;Impossible, sir, impossible.</p>

<p>Professor&mdash;But how did you satisfy yourself?</p>

<p>Uncle Jim&mdash;Dug 'em up, sir&mdash;dug 'em up speaking with more
than usual moderation. I'd heard that yarn. The next voyage, I took the
bo'sen and went ashore; we dug up 275 old Patagonians and measured 'em.
They all measured exactly five feet nine inches and a half; no difference
in 'em&mdash;men, women, and all ages just the same. Five feet nine inches
and a half is the natural height of a Patagonian. They've always been just
that. Not a word of truth in the stories about giants,
sir.&mdash;<i>Harper's Magazine</i>.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Puddin"></a>Puddin' Tame's Fun.</h2>

<p>"Nice child, very nice child," observed an old gentleman, crossing the
aisle and addressing the mother of the boy who had just hit him in the eye
with a wad of paper. "How old are you, my son?"</p>

<p>"None of your business," replied the youngster, taking aim at another
passenger.</p>

<p>"Fine boy," smiled the old man, as the parent regarded her offspring
with pride. "A remarkably fine boy. What is your name, my son?"</p>

<p>"Puddin' Tame!" shouted the youngster, with a giggle at his own
wit.</p>

<p>"I thought so," continued the old man, pleasantly. "If you had given me
three guesses at it, that would have been the first one I would have
struck on. Now, Puddin', you can blow those things pretty straight, can't
you?"</p>

<p>"You bet!" squealed the boy, delighted at the compliment. "See me take
that old fellow over there!"</p>

<p>"No, no!" exclaimed the old gentleman, hastily. "Try it on the old
woman I was sitting with. She has boys of her own, and she won't
mind."</p>

<p>"Can you hit the lady for the gentleman, Johnny?" asked the fond
parent.</p>

<p>Johnny drew a bead and landed the pellet on the end of the old woman's
nose. But she did mind it, and, rising in her wrath, soared down on the
small boy like a blizzard. She put him over the line, reversed him, ran
him backward till he didn't know which end of him was front, and finally
dropped him into the lap of the scared mother, with a benediction whereof
the purport was that she'd be back in a moment and skin him alive.</p>

<p>"She didn't seem to like it, Puddin'," smiled the gentleman, softly.
"She's a perfect stranger to me, but I understand she is a matron of
truants' home, and I thought she would like a little fun; but I was
mistaken."</p>

<p>And the old gentleman sighed sweetly as he went back to his seat.</p>

<hr class="c33" />

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Alphabet"></a>The Alphabet.</h2>

<p>The discovery of the alphabet is at once the triumph, the instrument
and the register of the progress of our race. The oldest abecedarium in
existence is a child's alphabet on a little ink-bottle of black ware found
on the site of Cere, one of the oldest of the Greek settlements in Central
Italy, certainly older than the end of the sixth century B. C. The
Ph&oelig;nician alphabet has been reconstructed from several hundred
inscriptions. The "Moabite Stone" has yielded the honor of being the most
ancient of alphabetic records to the bronze plates found in Lebanon in
1872, fixed as of the tenth or eleventh century, and therefore the
earliest extant monuments of the Semitic alphabet. The lions of Nineveh
and an inscribed scarab found at Khorsabad have furnished other early
alphabets; while scarabs and cylinders, seals and gems, from Babylon and
Nineveh, with some inscriptions, are the scanty records of the first epoch
of the Ph&oelig;nician alphabet. For the second period, a sarcophagus
found in 1855, with an inscription of twenty-two lines, has tasked the
skill of more than forty of the most eminent Semitic scholars of the day,
and the literature connected with it is overwhelming. An unbroken series
of coins extending over seven centuries from 522 B. C. to 153 A. D.,
Hebrew engraved gems, the Siloam inscription discovered in Jerusalem in
1880, early Jewish coins, have each and all found special students whose
successive progress is fully detailed by Taylor. The Aramæan alphabet
lived only for seven or eight centuries; but from it sprang the scripts of
five great faiths of Asia and the three great literary alphabets of the
East. Nineveh and its public records supply most curious revelations of
the social life and commercial transactions of those primitive times.
Loans, leases, notes, sales of houses, slaves, etc., all dated, show the
development of the alphabet. The early Egyptian inscriptions show which
alphabet was there in the reign of Xerxes. Fragments on stone preserved in
old Roman walls in Great Britain, Spain, France, and Jerusalem, all supply
early alphabets.</p>

<p>Alphabets have been affected by religious controversies, spread by
missionaries, and preserved in distant regions by holy faith, in spite of
persecution and perversion. The Arabic alphabet, next in importance after
the great Latin alphabet, followed in eighty years the widespread religion
of Mohammed; and now the few Englishmen who can read and speak it are
astonished to learn that it is collaterally related to our own alphabet,
and that both can be traced back to the primitive Ph&oelig;nician
source.</p>

<p>Greece alone had forty local alphabets, reduced by careful study to
about half a dozen generic groups, characterized by certain common local
features, and also by political connection.</p>

<p>Of the oldest "a, b, c's" found in Italy, several were scribbled by
school-boys on Pompeian walls, six in Greek, four in Oscan, four in Latin;
others were scratched on children's cups, buried with them in their
graves, or cut or painted for practice on unused portions of mortuary
slabs. The earliest was found as late as 1882, a plain vase of black ware
with an Etruscan inscription and a syllabary or spelling exercise, and the
Greek alphabet twice repeated.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="CanDo"></a>What a Child Can Do.</h2>

<p>"Pa, I have signed the pledge," said a little boy to his father, on
coming home one evening; "will you help me keep it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said the father.</p>

<p>"Well, I have brought a copy of the pledge; will you sign it,
papa?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense, nonsense, my child! What could I do when my brother-officers
called&mdash;the father had been in the army&mdash;if I was a
teetotaler?"</p>

<p>"But do try, papa."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut! why you are quite a little radical."</p>

<p>"Well, you won't ask me to pass the bottle, papa?"</p>

<p>"You are quite a fanatic, my child; but I promise not to ask you to
touch it."</p>

<p>Some weeks after that two officers called in to spend the evening.</p>

<p>"What have you to drink?" said they.</p>

<p>"Have you any more of that prime Scotch ale?"</p>

<p>"No," said he; "I have not, but I shall get some. Here, Willie, run to
the store, and tell them to send some bottles up."</p>

<p>The boy stood before his father respectfully, but did not go.</p>

<p>"Come, Willie; why, what's the matter? Come, run along." He went, but
came back presently without any bottles.</p>

<p>"Where's the ale, Willie?"</p>

<p>"I asked them for it at the store, and they put it upon the counter,
but I could not touch it. O pa, pa! don't be angry; I told them to send it
up, but I could not touch it myself!"</p>

<p>The father was deeply moved, and turning to his brother-officers, he
said:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, do you hear that? You can do as you please. When the ale
comes you may drink it, but not another drop shall be drank in my house,
and not another drop shall pass my lips. Willie, have you your temperance
pledge?"</p>

<p>"O pa! I have."</p>

<p>"Bring it, then."</p>

<p>And the boy was back with it in a moment. The father signed it and the
little fellow clung round his father's neck with delight. The ale came,
but not one drank, and the bottles stood on the table untouched.</p>

<p>Children, sign the pledge, and ask your parents to help you keep it.
Don't touch the bottle, and try to keep others from touching it.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Frank_Dobbs"></a>FRANK DOBB'S WIVES.</h2>

<p>"The great trouble with my son," old Dobb observed to me once, "is that
he is a genius."</p>

<p>And the old gentleman sighed and looked with melancholy eyes at the
picture on the genius's easel. It was a clever picture, but everything
Frank Dobb did was clever, from his painting to his banjo playing. Clever
was the true name for it, for of substantial merit it possessed none. He
had begun to paint without learning to draw, and he could pick a tune out
of any musical instrument extant without ever having mastered the
mysteries of notes. He talked the most graceful of airy nothings, and
could not cover a page of note paper without his orthography going lame,
and all the rest of his small acquirements and accomplishments were
proportionately shallow and incomplete. Paternal partiality laid it to his
being too gifted to study, but the cold logic, which no ties of
consanguinity influenced, ascribed it to laziness.</p>

<p>Frank was, indeed, the idlest and best-natured fellow in the world. You
never saw him busy, angry, or out of spirits. He painted a little,
thrummed his guitar a little longer or rattled a tune off on his piano,
smoked and read a great deal, and flirted still more, all in the same
deliberate and easy-going way. Any excuse was sufficient to absolve him
from serious work. So he lead a pleasant, useless life, with Dobb senior
to pay the bills.</p>

<p>He had the handsomest studio in New York, a studio for one of Ouida's
heroes to luxuriate in. If the encouragement of picturesque surroundings
could have made a painter of him he would have been a master. The fame of
his studio, and the fact that he did not need the money, made his pictures
sell. He was quite a lion in society, and it was regarded as a favor to be
asked to call on him. He was the beau ideal of the artist of romance, and
was accorded a romantic eminence accordingly<a name= "fnanchor_aa" id=
"fnanchor_aa"></a><a href= "#footnote_aa" class= "fnanchor">[aa]</a>. So,
with his pictures to provide him with pocket money, and his father to see
to the rest, he lived the life of a young prince, feted and flattered and
spoiled, artistically despised by all the serious workers who knew him,
and hated by some who envied him the commercial success he had no
necessity for, but esteemed by most of us as a good fellow and his own
worst enemy.</p>

<p>Frank married his first wife while Dobb senior was still at the helm of
his own affairs. She was a charming little woman whose acquaintance he had
made when she visited his studio with a party of friends. She had not a
penny, but he made a draft upon "the governor," as he called him, and the
happy pair digested their honeymoon in Europe. They were absent six
months, during which time he did not set brush to canvas. Then they
returned, as he fancifully termed it, to go to work.</p>

<p>He commenced the old life as if he had never been married. The familiar
sound of pipes and beer, and supper after the play, often with young
ladies who had been assisting in the representation on the stage, was
traveled as if there had been no Mrs. Dobb at home in the flat old Dobb
provided. Frank's expenditures on himself were as lavish as they had been
in his bachelor days. As little Brown said, it was lucky that Mrs. Dobb
had a father-in-law to buy her dinner for her. She rarely came to her
husband's studio, because he claimed that it interfered with the course of
business. He had invented a fiction that she was too weak to endure the
strain of society, and so he took her into it as little as possible. In
brief, married by the caprice of a selfish man, the poor little woman
lived through a couple of neglected years, and then died of a malady as
nearly akin to a broken heart as I can think of, while Frank was making a
trip to the Bahamas on the yacht of his friend Munnybagge, of the Stock
Exchange.</p>

<p>He had set out on the voyage ostensibly to make studies, for he was a
marine painter, on the principle, probably, that marines are easiest to
paint. When he came back and found his wife dead, he announced that he
would move his studio to Havana for the purpose of improving his art. He
did so, putting off his mourning suit the day after he left New York and
not putting it on again, as the evidence of creditable witnesses on the
steamer and in Havana has long since proved.</p>

<p>His son's callousness was a savage stab in old Dobb's heart. A little,
mild-looking old gentleman, without a taint of selfishness or suspicion in
his own nature, he had not seen the effect of his indulgence of him on his
son till his brutal disregard for his first duty as a man had told him of
it. The old man had appreciated and loved his daughter-in-law. In
proportion as he had discovered her unhappiness and its just cause, he had
lost his affection for his son. I hear that there was a terrible scene
when Frank came home, a week after his wife had been buried. He claimed to
have missed the telegram announcing her death to him at Nassau, but
Munnybagge had already told some friends that he had got the dispatch in
time for the steamer, but had remained over till the next one, because he
had a flirtation on hand with little Gonzales, the Cuban heiress, and old
Dobb had heard of it. Munnybagge never took him yachting again; and,
speaking to me once about him, he designated him, not by name, but as
"that infernal bloodless cad."</p>

<p>However, as I have said, there was a desperate row between father and
son, and Frank is said to have slunk out of the house like a whipped cur,
and been quite dull company at the supper which he took after the opera
that night in Gillian Trussell's jolly Bohemian flat. When he emigrated,
with his studio traps filling half a dozen packing cases, none of the boys
bothered to see him off. They had learned to see through his good
fellowship, and recalled a poor little phantom, to whose life and
happiness he had been a wicked and bitter enemy.</p>

<p>About a year after his departure I read the announcement in the Herald
of the marriage of Franklin D. Dobb, Sr., to a widow well-known and
popular in society. I took the trouble to ascertain that it was Frank's
father, and being among some of the boys that night, mentioned it to
them.</p>

<p>"Well," remarked Smith, "that's really queer. You remember Frank left
some things in my care when he went away? Yesterday I got a letter asking
about them, and informing me that he had got married and was coming
home."</p>

<p>He did come home, and he settled in his old studio. What sort of a
meeting he had with his father this time I never heard. The old gentleman
had been paying him his allowance regularly while he was away, and I
believe he kept up the payment still. But otherwise he gave him no help,
and if he ever needed help he did now.</p>

<p>His wife was a Cuban, as pretty and as helpless as a doll. She had been
an heiress till her brother had turned rebel and had his property
confiscated. Unfortunately for Frank, he had married her before the
culmination of this catastrophe. In fact, he had been paying court to her
with the dispatch announcing his wife's death in his pocket, and had
married her long before the poor little clay was well settled in the grave
he had sent it to. In marrying her he had evidently believed he was
establishing his future. So he was, but it was a future of expiation for
the sins and omissions of his past.</p>

<p>The new Mrs. Dobb was a tigress in her love and her jealousy. She was
childish and ignorant, and adored her husband as a man and an artist. She
measured his value by her estimation of him, and was on the watch
perpetually for trespassers on her domain. The domestic outbreaks between
the two were positively blood curdling. One afternoon, I remember, Gillian
Trussell, who had heard of his return, called on him. Mrs. D. met her at
the studio door, told her, "Frank," as she called him, was out; slammed
the door in her face, and then flew at him with a palette scraper. We had
to break the door in, and found him holding her off by both wrists, and
she frothing in a mad fit of hysterics. From that day he was a changed
man. She owned him body and soul.</p>

<p>The life the pair lived after that was simply ridiculously<a name=
"fnanchor_bb" id= "fnanchor_bb"></a><a href= "#footnote_bb" class=
"fnanchor">[bb]</a> miserable. He had lost his old social popularity, and
was forced to sell his pictures to the cheap dealers, when he was lucky
enough to sell them at all. The paternal allowance would not support the
flat they first occupied, and they went into a boarding house. Inside of a
month they were in the papers, on account of outbreaks on Mrs. Dobb's part
against one of the ladies of the house. A couple of days after he leased a
little room opening into his studio, converted it into a bed-room, and
they settled there for good.</p>

<p>Such a housekeeping as it was&mdash;like a scene in a farce. The studio
had long since run to seed, and a perpetual odor of something to eat hung
over it along with the sickening reek of the Florida water Mrs. D., like
all other creoles, made more liberal use of than of the pure element it
was half-named from. Crumbs and crusts and chop-bones, which the dog had
left, littered the rugs; and I can not recall the occasion on which the
caterer's tin box was not standing at the door, unless it was when the
dirty plates were piled up, there waiting for him to come for them. I
dined there once. Frank had had a savage quarrel with her that day, and
wanted me for a bender. But the scheme availed him nothing, for she broke
out over the soup and I left them to fight it out, and finished my feast
at a chop house.</p>

<p>All of his old flirtations came back to curse him now. His light loves
of the playhouse and his innocent devotions of the ball room were alike
the instruments fate had forged into those of punishment for him. The very
names of his old fancies, which, with that subtle instinct all women
possess, she had found out, were sufficient to send his wife into a
frenzy. She was a chronic theatre-goer, and they never went to the theatre
without bringing a quarrel home with them. If he was silent at the play
she charged him with neglecting her; if he brisked up and tried to chat,
her jealousy would soon pick out some casus belli in the small talk he
strove to interest her with. A word to a passing friend, a glance at one
of her own sex, was sufficient to set her going. I shall never question
that jealousy is a form of actual madness, after what I saw of it in the
lives of that miserable man and woman.</p>

<p>A year after his return he was the ghost of his old self. He was
haggard and often unshaven; his attire was shabby and carelessly put on;
he had lost his old, jaunty air, and went by you with a hurried pace, and
his head and shoulders bent with an indescribable suggestion of humility.
The fear of having her break out, regardless of any one who might be by,
which hung over him at home, haunted him out of doors, too. The avenger of
Mrs. Dobb the first had broken his spirit as effectually as he had broken
Mrs. Dobb's heart. Smith occupied the next studio to him, and one evening
I was smoking there, when an atrocious uproar commenced in the next room.
We could distinguish Frank's voice and his wife's, and another strange
one. Smith looked at me, grinned, and shrugged his shoulders. The
disturbance ceased in a couple of minutes, and a door banged.</p>

<p>Then came a crash, a shrill and furious scream, and the sound of feet.
We ran to the door, in time to see Mrs. Dobb, her hair in a tangle down
her back, in a dirty wrapper and slipshod slippers, stumbling down stairs.
We posted after her, Smith nearly breaking his neck by tripping over one
of the slippers which she had shed as she ran. The theatres were just out
and the streets full of people, among whom she jostled her way like the
mad woman that she was. We came up with her as she overtook her husband,
who was walking with McGilp, the dealer who handled his pictures. She
seized him by the arm and screamed out:</p>

<p>"I told you I would come with you."</p>

<p>His face for a moment was the face of a devil, full of fury and
despair. I saw his fist clench itself and the big vein in his forehead
swell. But he slipped his hands into his pockets, looked appealingly at
McGilp, and said, shrugging his shoulders, "You see how it is, Mac?"</p>

<p>McGilp nodded and walked abruptly away, with a look full of contempt
and scorn. We mingled with the crowd and saw the poor wretches go off
together, he grim and silent, she hysterically excited&mdash;with all the
world staring at them. Smith slept on a lounge in my room that night. "I
couldn't get a wink up there," he said, "and I don't want to be even the
ear witness of a murder."</p>

<p>The night did not witness the tragedy he anticipated, though. Next day,
Frank Dobb came to see me&mdash;a compliment he had not paid me for
months. He was the incarnation of abject misery, and so nervous that he
could scarcely speak intelligibly.</p>

<p>"I saw you in the crowd last night, old man," he said, looking at the
floor and twisting and untwisting his fingers. "What do you think of it? A
nice life for a fellow to lead, eh?"</p>

<p>What else could I reply than, "Why do you lead it then?"</p>

<p>"Why?" he repeated, breaking into a hollow, uneasy laugh. "Why, because
I love her, damn me! and I deserve it all."</p>

<p>"Is this what you came to tell me?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No," he answered, "of course not. The fact is, I want you to help me
out of a hole. That row last night has settled me with McGilp. He came to
see me about a lot of pictures for a sale he is getting up out West, and
the senora kept up such a nagging that he got sick and suggested that we
should go to 'The Studio' for a chop and settle the business there. She
swore I shouldn't go, and that she would follow us if I did. I thought
she'd not go that far; but she did. So the McGilp affair is off for good,
I know. He's disgusted, and I don't blame him. What I want of you is this.
Buy that Hoguet you wanted last year."</p>

<p>The picture was one I had fancied and offered him a price for in his
palmy days, one that he had picked up abroad. I was only too glad to take
it and a couple more, for which I paid him at once; and next evening, at
dinner, I heard that he had levanted. "Walked out this morning," said
Smith, "and sent a messenger an hour after with word that he had already
left the city. She came in to me with the letter in one hand and a dagger
in the other. She swears he has run away with another woman, and says
she's going to have her life, if she has to follow her around the
world."</p>

<p>She did not carry out her sanguinary purpose, though. There were some
consultations with old Dobb and then the studio was to let again. Some one
told me she had returned to Cuba, where she proposed to live on the
allowance her father-in-law had made her husband and which he now
continued to her.</p>

<p>I had almost forgotten her when, several years later, in the lobby of
the Academy of Music, she touched my arm with her fan. She was promenading
on the arm of a handsome but beefy-looking Englishman, whom she introduced
to me as her husband. I had not heard of a divorce, but I took the
introduction as information that there had been one. The Englishman was a
better fellow than he looked. We supped together after the opera, and I
learned that he had met Mrs. Dobb in Havana, where he had spent some years
in business. I found her a changed woman&mdash;a new woman, indeed, in
whom I only now and then caught a glimpse of her old indolent, babyish and
foolish self. She was not only prettier than ever, but she had become a
sensible and clever woman. The influence of an intelligent man, who was
strong enough to bend her to his ways, had developed her latent brightness
and taught her to respect herself as well as him.</p>

<p>I met her several times after that, and at the last meeting but one she
spoke of Frank for the first time. Her black eyes snapped when she uttered
his name. The devil was alive in them, though love was dead.</p>

<p>I told her that I had heard nothing of him since his disappearance.</p>

<p>"But I have," she said, showing her white teeth in a curious smile.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" I replied, quite astounded.</p>

<p>"The coward!" she went on bitterly; "and to think I could ever have
loved such a thing as he! Do you know, Mr. X., that I never knew he had
been married till after he had fled? Then his father told me how he had
courted my father's money, with his wife lying dead at home. Oh! Senor
Francisco, Senor Francisco! Before I heard that, I wanted to kill the
woman who had stolen you from me. The moment after I could have struck you
dead at my feet."</p>

<p>She threw her arm up, holding her fan like a dagger. I believed her,
and so would any one who had seen her then.</p>

<p>"I had hardly settled in Havana," she continued, "before I received a
letter from him. <span class="pagenum">[Pg 191]</span>Already he wanted to
come back to me. Had the other woman tired of him already? I asked myself,
or was it really true, as his father had told me, that he had fled alone?
I answered the letter, and he wrote again. Again I answered, and so it was
kept up. For two years I played with the love I now knew was worthless. He
was traveling round the world, and a dozen times wanted to come directly
to me. I insisted that he should keep his journey up&mdash;as a probation,
you see. He submitted. But oh! how he did love me!"</p>

<p>The exultation with which she told this was absolutely fiendish. I
could see in it, plainer than any words could tell it to me, the scheme of
vengeance she had carried out, the alternating hopes and torments to which
she had raised, and into which she had plunged him. I could see him
wandering around the globe, scourged by remorses, agonized by doubts, and
maddened by despairs, accepting the lies she wrote him as inviolable
pledges, and sustaining himself with the vision of a future never to be
fulfilled. She read the expression of my face, and laughed.</p>

<p>"Was it not an idea?" she asked. "Was that not better than this?"</p>

<p>And again she stabbed the air with her fan.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;pardon me the question&mdash;but you have begun the
confidence," I said. "How will it end?"</p>

<p>"It has ended," she answered.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I had been divorced while I was writing to him. A year ago he was to
be in London, where I was to meet him. While he was sailing from the Cape
of Good Hope I was being married to a man who loved me for myself, and to
whom I had confided all. Instead of my address at the London post office
he received a notification of my marriage, addressed to him in my own hand
and mailed to him by myself. He wrote once or twice still, but my husband
indorsed the letters with his own name and returned them unopened. He may
be dead for all I know, but I hope and pray he is still alive, and will
remain alive and love me for a thousand years."</p>

<p>She opened her arms, as if to hug her vengeance to her heart, and
looked at me steadily with eyes that thrilled me with their lambent fire.
No wonder the wretched vagabond loved her! What a doom his selfishness and
his duplicity had invoked upon him! I believe if he could have seen her as
I saw her then, so different from and better than he knew her to be, he
would have gone mad on the spot. Poor Mrs. Dobb the first was indeed
avenged.</p>

<p>We sipped our chocolate and talked of other things, as if such a being
as Frank Dobb had never been. Her husband joined us and we made an evening
of it at the theatre. I knew from the way he looked at me, and from the
increased warmth of his manner, that he was conversant with his wife's
having made a confidant of me. But I do not think he knew how far her
confidence had gone. I have often wondered since if he knew how deep and
fierce the hatred she carried for his predecessor was. There are things
women will reveal to strangers which they will die rather than divulge to
those they love.</p>

<p>I saw them off to Europe, for they were going to establish themselves
in London, and I have never seen or directly heard from them since. But
some months after their departure I received a letter from Robinson, who
has been painting there ever since his picture made that great hit in the
Salon of '7&mdash;.</p>

<p>"I have odd news for you," he wrote. "You remember Frank Dobb, who
belonged to our old Pen and Pencil Club, and who ran away from that Cuban
wife of his just before I left home? Well, about a year ago I met him in
Fleet street, the shabbiest beggar you ever saw. He was quite tight and
smelled of gin across the street. He was taking a couple of drawings to a
penny dreadful office which he was making pictures for at ten shillings a
piece. I went to see him once, in the dismalest street back of Drury Lane.
He was doing some painting for a dealer, when he was sober enough, and of
all the holes you ever saw his was it. I soon had to sit down on him, for
he got into the habit of coming to see me and loafing around, making the
studio smell like a pub, till I would lend him five shillings to go away.
I heard nothing of him till the other day I came across an event which
this from the Telegraph will explain."</p>

<p>The following newspaper paragraph was appended:</p>

<p>"The man who shot himself on the door-step of Mr. Bennerley Green, the
West India merchant, last Monday, has been discovered to be an American
who for some time has been employed furnishing illustrations to the lower
order of publications here. He was known as Allan, but this is said to
have been an assumed name. He is stated to be the son of a wealthy New
Yorker, who discarded him in consequence of his habits of dissipation, and
to have once been an artist of considerable prominence in the United
States. All that is known of the suicide is the story told by the servant,
who a few minutes after admitting his master and mistress upon their
return from the theatre, heard the report of a pistol in the street, and
on opening the door found the wretched man dead upon the step. The body
was buried after the inquest at the charge of the eminent American artist,
Mr. J. J. Robinson, A. R. A., who had known him in his better days."</p>

<p>In promulgating your esoteric cogitation on articulating superficial
sentimentalities and philosophical psychological observation, beware of
platitudinous ponderosity. Let your conversation possess a clarified
conciseness, compact comprehensiveness, coalescent consistency, and a
concatenated cognancy; eschew all conglomerations of flatulent garrulity
and jejune babblement. In other words, don't use such big words.</p>

not get more like it, I would not sell the three bushels I raised from the
quart for $100. <span class="smcap">Wm. Steabner</span>, Sorlien's Mill,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
